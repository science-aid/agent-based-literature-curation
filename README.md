# Agent-based Literature Curation

AI agent-based system for precision literature curation for papers of genetic research of non-model species.

## Overview

This repository contains code and data for curation of scientific literature using AI agents. We compare three approaches for identifying non-model organism genetics papers.

## Key Features

- **AI Agent-based Curation**: Automated literature screening using large language model agents
- **Precision Comparison**: Benchmark of multiple NER systems (BioMNI, Custom BioMNI, PubTator)
- **Focus Area**: Non-model organism genetics research papers

## Methods Compared

- **Default Biomni**: Baseline biological entity recognition
- **Custom Biomni**: Enhanced with domain-specific customization
- **PubTator**: NCBI's literature annotation system

## Results

Our custom Biomni approach achieved higher precision in identifying relevant non-model organism genetics papers compared to existing methods.

## Data Availability

**Note**: Full dataset and analysis code will be made available shortly after the conference presentation.
