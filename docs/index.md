# Agent-based Literature Curation

## What is this?

**AIエージェント（Biomni）を使ったノイズの少ない論文セット取得の検証**

This research validates a method for obtaining high-quality, low-noise literature sets using AI agents (Biomni) for scientific paper curation.

---

## Methodology

We tested **three different approaches** for literature curation and validated their performance by comparing **Precision** scores:

- **Default Biomni**: Standard biological entity recognition
- **Custom Biomni**: Domain-optimized configuration
- **PubTator**: NCBI's annotation system

!!! note "Performance Metrics"
    Currently validated using **Precision** only. Other metrics such as Accuracy and F1-score are not yet evaluated.
