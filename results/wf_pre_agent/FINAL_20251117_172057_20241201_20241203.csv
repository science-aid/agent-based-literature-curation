39614978,Komagataella phaffii,460519,,,Engineering Komagataella phaffii for ethylene glycol production from xylose.,"Ethylene glycol (EG) is a versatile molecule produced in the petrochemical industry and is widely used to manufacture plastic polymers, anti-freeze, and automotive fluids. Biotechnological production of EG from xylose, a pentose present in lignocellulose biomass hydrolysates, has been achieved by the engineering of bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with synthetic pathways. In the present work, the Dahms pathway was employed to construct Komagataella phaffii strains capable of producing EG from xylose. Different combinations of the four enzymes that compose the synthetic pathway, namely, xylose dehydrogenase, xylonate dehydratase, dehydro-deoxy-xylonate aldolase, and glycolaldehyde reductase, were successfully expressed in K. phaffii. Increased production of EG (1.31 g/L) was achieved by employing a newly identified xylonate dehydratase (xylD-HL). This xylonate dehydratase allowed 30% higher EG production than a previously known xylonate dehydratase (xylD-CC). Further strain engineering demonstrated that K. phaffii possesses native glycolaldehyde reduction and oxidation activities, which lead to pathway deviation from EG to glycolic acid (GA) production. Finally, cultivation conditions that favor the production of EG over GA were determined.",
39615327,Muscovy ducks,8855,,,miR-317 regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of duck follicle granulosa cells by targeting VIPR1.,"VIPR1 can specifically bind VIP, a PRL release factor, which promotes the secretion of PRL from the pituitary gland, and participates in the regulation of bird nesting behavior. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of miR-317 overexpression or silencing on VIPR1 gene and protein expression in duck follicle granulosa cells. The ovaries of Muscovy ducks were collected during the nesting and laying periods, and histological differences were analyzed via HE staining. Duck primary follicle granulosa cells were isolated and identified by immunofluorescence staining, after which the cells were transfected with miR-317, mimic-NC, miR-317 mimic, inhibitor-NC or miR-317 inhibitor Alterations in cell proliferation were then analyzed by EdU staining, and cell apoptosis was assessed by Annexin-V-FITC flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. Fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to assess the expression level of VIPR1 after miR-317 overexpression or silencing. Total protein was extracted from the follicle granulosa cells, and protein levels were analyzed via Western blotting. The results revealed that the nucleus of the ovarian granule in Muscovy ducks was more concentrated and distinct from the surrounding cells during the brooding period than during the laying period. More than 90 % of the cells were identified as duck follicle granulosa cells by immunofluorescence staining of FSHR and LHR. miR-317 expression was significantly higher in the miR-317 mimic-transfected group than in the miRNA-NC-transfected group (P < 0.01); similarly, miR-317 expression was significantly lower in the inhibitor-transfected group than in the miRNA inhibitor-transfected group (P < 0.01), indicating that miR-317 overexpression and interference vectors were successfully constructed and transfected into duck follicular granulosa cells. EdU staining revealed that the number of EdU-positive cells was significantly greater in the miR-317 mimic-transfected group than in the mimic-NC-transfected group (P < 0.05); after miR-317 silencing or inhibition, cell proliferation decreased, and the number of EdU-positive cells significantly decreased (P < 0.01). TUNEL staining revealed that the proportion of red, TUNEL-positive cells in the miR-317 inhibitor interference group was significantly greater than that in the miR-NC, miR-317 mimic, or inhibitor-NC group (P < 0.05). These results suggest that miR-317 inhibition promoted the apoptosis of duck follicle granulosa cells. Flow cytometry revealed that the percentage of apoptotic cells was 14.23 % and 22.75 % in the inhibitor-NC and miR-317 inhibitor groups, respectively (P < 0.01). Fluorescence quantitative PCR revealed that, compared with that in the corresponding control groups, VIPR1 gene expression was significantly lower in the miR-317 mimic group (P < 0.05) but significantly higher in the miR-317 inhibitor group (P < 0.05). Western blot analysis revealed that VIPR1 levels were significantly lower in the miR-317 mimic group than in the mimic-NC group (P < 0.05) but significantly greater in the miR-317 inhibitor group (P < 0.05). In summary, miR-317 inhibition promoted the apoptosis of duck follicle granulosa cells, and miR-317 overexpression promoted the proliferation of duck follicle granulosa cells and negatively regulated expression of the target gene VIPR1 at the gene and protein levels. This study further reveals the molecular mechanism underlying follicular atresia and serves as a reference for reducing the broodiness of Muscovy ducks.",Animals; Female; MicroRNAs; Apoptosis; Granulosa Cells; Ducks; Cell Proliferation; Avian Proteins

39615486,Staphylococcus aureus,1280,ClpP,8192,Structure-guided development of selective caseinolytic protease P agonists as antistaphylococcal agents.,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous pathogen, posing a serious threat to human health worldwide. Thus, there is a high demand for antibiotics with distinct targets. Caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) is a promising target for combating staphylococcal infections; however, selectively activating S. aureus ClpP (SaClpP) rather than Homo sapiens ClpP (HsClpP) remains challenging. Herein, we rationally design and identify ZG297 by structure-based strategy. It binds and activates SaClpP instead of HsClpP. This is due to differentiated ligand binding attributed to crossed ""tyrosine/histidine"" amino acid pairs. ZG297 substantially inhibits the growth of a broad panel of S. aureus strains in vitro, outperforming the selective (R)-ZG197 agonist. ZG297 also functions as a potent antibiotic against multidrug-resistant S. aureus infections in Galleria mellonella larvae, zebrafish, murine skin, and thigh infection models. Collectively, we demonstrate that ZG297 is a safer and more potent antistaphylococcal agent than acyldepsipeptide 4 and (R)-ZG197.",Animals; Endopeptidase Clp; Mice; Zebrafish; Staphylococcal Infections; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Humans; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Bacterial Proteins; Staphylococcus aureus; Structure-Activity Relationship; Moths
39615687,Thermus thermophilus,274,,,The structural basis for high-affinity c-di-GMP binding to the GSPII-B domain of the traffic ATPase PilF from Thermus thermophilus.,"c-di-GMP is an important second messenger in bacteria regulating, for example motility, biofilm formation, cell wall biosynthesis, infectivity, and natural transformability. It binds to a multitude of intracellular receptors. This includes proteins containing general secretory pathway II (GSPII) domains such as the N-terminal domain of the Vibrio cholerae ATPase MshE (MshEN) which binds c-di-GMP with two copies of a 24-amino acids sequence motif. The traffic ATPase PilF from Thermus thermophilus is important for type IV pilus biogenesis, twitching motility, surface attachment, and natural DNA-uptake and contains three consecutive homologous GPSII domains. We show that only two of these domains bind c-di-GMP and define the structural basis for the exceptional high affinity of the GSPII-B domain for c-di-GMP, which is 83-fold higher than that of the prototypical MshEN domain. Our work establishes an extended consensus sequence for the c-di-GMP-binding motif and highlights the role of hydrophobic residues for high-affinity recognition of c-di-GMP. Our structure is the first example for a c-di-GMP-binding domain not relying on arginine residues for ligand recognition. We also show that c-di-GMP-binding induces local unwinding of an α-helical turn as well as subdomain reorientation to reinforce intermolecular contacts between c-di-GMP and the C-terminal subdomain. Abolishing c-di-GMP binding to GSPII-B reduces twitching motility and surface attachment but not natural DNA-uptake. Overall, our work contributes to a better characterization of c-di-GMP binding in this class of effector domains, allows the prediction of high-affinity c-di-GMP-binding family members, and advances our understanding of the importance of c-di-GMP binding for T4P-related functions.","Thermus thermophilus; Cyclic GMP; Bacterial Proteins; Protein Domains; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Protein Binding; Models, Molecular"
39616241,Brassica juncea,3707,,,A wide range of chromosome numbers result from unreduced gamete production in Brassica juncea × B. napus (AABC) interspecific hybrids.,"The establishment of successful interspecies hybrids requires restoration of a stable ""2n"" chromosome complement which can produce viable ""n"" gametes. This may occur (rarely) via recombination between non-homologous chromosomes, or more commonly is associated with a doubling of parental chromosome number to produce new homologous pairing partners in the hybrid. The production of unreduced ""2n"" gametes (gametes with the somatic chromosome number) may therefore be evolutionarily useful by serving as a key pathway for the formation of new polyploid hybrids, as might specific mechanisms permitting recombination between non-homologous chromosomes. Here, we investigated chromosome complements and fertility in third generation interspecific hybrids (AABC) resulting from a cross between allopolyploids Brassica juncea (AABB) × B. napus (AACC) followed by self-pollination for two generations. Chromosome numbers ranged from 2n = 48-74 in the experimental population (35 plants), with 9-16 B genome chromosomes and up to 4 copies of A genome chromosomes. Unreduced gamete production leading to a putative genome structure of approximately AAAABBCC was hence predicted to explain the high chromosome numbers observed. Additionally, the estimation of nuclei number in post-meiotic sporads revealed a higher frequency of unreduced gametes (0.04-5.21%) in the third generation AABC interspecific hybrids compared to the parental Brassica juncea (0.07%) and B. napus (0.13%). Our results suggest that unreduced gamete production in the subsequent generations following interspecific hybridization events may play a critical role in restoration of more stable, fertile chromosome complements.","Mustard Plant; Chromosomes, Plant; Hybridization, Genetic; Brassica napus; Polyploidy; Genome, Plant; Crosses, Genetic; Germ Cells, Plant; Fertility"
39616385,coronavirus,694013,NF-kappaB,4790,Linear ubiquitination mediates coronavirus NSP14-induced NF-κB activation.,"Human coronaviruses exhibit a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild seasonal colds to severe respiratory manifestations. Despite progress in understanding the host's innate defense mechanisms against coronaviruses, how these viruses manipulate the immune response to promote inflammation remains elusive. In this study, we unveil the role of the coronavirus nonstructural protein 14 (NSP14) in leveraging the host's linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) to instigate NF-κB activation, thereby triggering proinflammatory responses. Our findings uncover that HOIL-1-interacting protein (HOIP) directly engages with NSP14, conferring linear polyubiquitin chains onto NSP14. Consequently, ubiquitinated NSP14 recruits NEMO and initiates the activation of the IKK complex. This NSP14-induced NF-κB activation stimulates the expression of proinflammatory factors but not type I interferon, leading to a skewed host innate immune response tilting to inflammation. Collectively, our study sheds light on a virus-initiated linear ubiquitination pathway that induces NF-κB signaling and provokes proinflammatory responses.","Ubiquitination; NF-kappa B; Humans; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; HEK293 Cells; I-kappa B Kinase; Signal Transduction; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Immunity, Innate; Animals; Coronavirus; Inflammation"

Furthermore, the reduced virulence of the RpoB H481Y mutant was abrogated in the presence of N-acetylcysteine, a reactive oxygen species scavenger. These results suggest that oxidative stress sensitivity caused by the RpoB H481Y rifampicin resistance mutation attenuates the virulence of S. aureus.","Oxidative Stress; Rifampin; Animals; Staphylococcus aureus; Virulence; Staphylococcal Infections; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Hydrogen Peroxide; Vitamin K 3; Bacterial Proteins; Mutation; Anti-Bacterial Agents; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Disease Models, Animal; Acetylcysteine"

In the modern era, they offer excellent pharmacological application prospects and find widespread use in the pharmaceutical industry. The current study revealed the synthesis and characterization of a novel 3-(2-bromo-5-fluorophenyl)-1-(thiophen-2-yl) prop-2-en-1-one (CY3). In vitro their antimicrobial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii), antifungal ( Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Candida albicans), cytotoxicity (VERO and Hep-G2 cells), in silico, and molecular docking analysis were also performed. The in-silico analysis evaluated the drug-likeness properties of the compound CY3 using various filtering rules, including Lipinski's, Ghose filter, Veber, Egan, Muegge, and Medicinal Chemistry alerts such as Pan Assay Interference Structures (PAINS), Brenk, and Lead-likeness. Then, molecular docking studies performed using the AutoDock (AD4), Vina, and iGEMDOCK tools to determine the mechanism by which the CY3 compound interact with the bacterial strains. Here, five different receptors were selected, such as DNA gyrase, glucose 6-phosphate synthase (GlmS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), dehydrosqualene synthase (DHSS), and undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase (UDPPS), for molecular docking analysis. The CY3 compound showed a good binding affinity with the two target proteins, DHFR and DHSS, respectively, with maximum binding energies of about - 7.07 and - 7.05 kcal/mol. The synthesized CY3 compound exhibited moderate antibacterial activity with a MIC value > 100 µg/mL against all five bacterial strains and moderate antifungal activity with a MIC value > 50 µg/mL against all three fungal strains.

39618182,sunflower,4232,,,Detecting the effect of intensive agriculture on Odonata diversity using citizen science data.,"Agricultural areas represent one of the major ecosystems of the world. Intensification of agricultural practices produced openfields characterized by low biological diversity. Nevertheless, the distance up to which intensive agricultural fields alter surrounding natural systems is rarely quantified. We determined the spatial scale at which agricultural landscapes alter the diversity of Odonates, a key taxon in wetland ponds, and we tested to what extent citizen science data can be used reliably for this purpose. We compiled 7731 observations made in a portion of the region Centre-Val-de-Loire (France) over 10 years by naturalists on 729 water bodies to analyze the effect of agricultural landscapes (mainly wheat, rapeseed, sunflower) on the species richness of both damselflies and dragonflies in lentic systems. Sixty species were reported over the 10-year period. For dragonflies, intensive agricultural landscapes best explained their richness at the scales of 800 and 1600 m for overall and autochthonous species, respectively, when using the full dataset. The spatial scale was smaller for damselflies, at 200 m for both overall and autochthonous species. These distances were not severely impacted when constraining the data to consider several biases. Multimodel averaging showed that the proportion of intensive agriculture decreased species richness, despite the potential biases inherent to an imperfect database acquired by citizens. This imperfect citizen dataset allows to infer the lowest effect size of agriculture on species richness. Quantitatively, this effect was more important for autochthonous species. Interestingly, both relatively rare taxa and common or generalist species can be under threat in intensive agricultural landscapes, calling for more ecotoxicological studies. The influence of agricultural practices from a distance implies that conservation and management plans of wetland ponds should consider the landscape ecological characteristics and not only the pond features. Conservation efforts focusing too locally on a site may be undermined because intensive agriculture from a distance limits the potential for the site to recover highly diverse communities. These distant effects should be integrated by policy-makers when deciding which wetland pond should benefit from a conservation plan or which conservation action may be planned, implementing, for instance, buffer zones and/or ecological corridors composed of natural vegetation.",Biodiversity; Animals; Odonata; Agriculture; Citizen Science; France; Environmental Monitoring

Nanotechnology, with its innovative approach, emerges as a promising solution to enhance the efficacy of these agents and combat the challenge of microbial resistance. Chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) stand out in biomedical applications, particularly in the controlled release of antibiotics, with their unique properties such as biocompatibility, stability, biodegradability, non-toxicity, and simple synthesis processes suitable for sensitive molecules. This study synthesized CSNPs using the ionotropic gelation method, with tripolyphosphate (TPP) as the crosslinking agent. Various CS: TPP ratios (6:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1) were tested, and the resulting nanoparticles were evaluated using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The CS: TPP ratio of 4:1, with an average hydrodynamic diameter (DHP) of (195 ± 10) nm and a zeta potential of (51 ± 1) mV, was identified as the most suitable for further analysis.

We know that bacteria exchange metabolites through the extracellular environment and communicate primarily via these secreted extracellular factors, yet it remained unclear whether bacteria can also use cell-cell connections to directly exchange nutrients, as evidenced in plant or mammal cells. Recent studies opened up great prospects by introducing some startling new discoveries on bacterial communication. Indeed, a previously uncharacterized type of bacterial communication mediated by nanotubes, small filaments connecting bacteria, that bridge neighboring cells was recently identified, making evidence of the existence of microstructures connecting bacterial cells together and allowing the transfer of molecules. Exploring the formation and the functioning of this new mechanism of bacterial communication in biofilms could lead for example, to better control of the major global problem of AMR. Thus, current studies have highlighted the crucial function of establishing tight connections between bacterial cells without answering a number of unresolved questions, especially those about their submicrometric biophysical characteristics. In this study, we provide new evidence of the existence of these nanotubes, using an unconventional approach in the analysis of biological samples based on scanning probe microscopy (SPM), precisely atomic force microscopy (AFM) in liquid, using Quantitative imaging mode, to investigate locally the properties of these intercellular bridges. This is, to our knowledge, the first time bacterial nanotubes are characterized by AFM in liquid on living bacteria. A protocol we developed enabled us to visualize these intercellular links on native bacteria without any immobilization. This challenging technique, unconventional for characterizing biological materials, enabled real-time nanomechanical mapping of these structures. By analyzing approach curves, the Young modulus was calculated, revealing new insights into their nanomechanical properties. Their lower Young's modulus (compared to that of the main body of the bacteria) suggest flexibility, which underscores an essential role in facilitating intercellular communication and material transfer.",

It gives plants their distinctive red color. A class of lipid-soluble natural pigments known as carotenoids is the precursor of vitamin A and is vital for antioxidant defense against peroxides in cells and tissues. This review provides an overview of the current state of knowledge and research on the sources, structures, physiochemical properties, absorption and metabolism, functional advantages, and prevention of many diseases associated with lycopene and beta-carotene. These antioxidants have been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and they also help draw pollinators to flowers. Carrots and sweet potatoes are also rich sources of beta-carotene, which strengthens the immune system and improves eye health. The vivid color of many plants reproductive organs, including flowers and fruits, is caused by carotenoid, a secondary metabolite that is produced in plastids. The distinctive red color and many other health advantages are attributed to lycopene. When ingested through food or supplements, lycopene and beta-carotene help manage and prevent a number of diseases, including cancer, metabolic, inflammatory, cardiovascular, hepatic, ophthalmic, skeletal, and infertility disorders. The main point is that toxicity is uncommon, and these carotenoids are generally accepted to be safe at different doses. Including these nutrients in your diet can improve your general health and provide illness prevention.",

While often associated with reputation management, which is considered uniquely human, it is unclear to what degree this phenomenon is shared with non-human animals. To investigate such audience effects in chimpanzees, we recorded the performance of six chimpanzees on three different numerical touch screen tasks varying in difficulty and cognitive demand, in the presence of variable audience member compositions over six years. Our results indicated that chimpanzee performance was influenced by the number and types of audience present. Performance increased for the most difficult task as the experimenter count increased, while for the easiest task, performance decreased as familiar audience and experimenter count increased. This suggests that audience effects on cognitive processing can be found in chimpanzees and that the evolutionary roots of this trait may date back to before the development of reputation-based normative societies in humans.",
39620906,Japanese quail,93934,,,Effect of Dietary Fortification With Hibiscus sabdariffa Calyces Meal on Egg Production and Egg Quality of Japanese Quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica).,"Use of synthetic feed additives in poultry production is associated with negative consumer health outcomes hence the need to make use of natural alternatives. We investigated the effect of fortifying Japanese quail pullet diets with Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces meal (HSCM) on egg production and egg quality. A standard Japanese quail layer diet was supplemented with HSCM at 0%, 5% and 10% (w/w) in Diets 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Ninety 5-week-old Japanese quail hens were randomly allocated to and fed the layer diets for 56 days. Feed intake, egg production, egg quality and the egg albumen and yolk proximate content and fatty acid profiles were determined. Dietary fortification with HSCM reduced feed intake (p < 0.001) but did not affect feed conversion ratio of the quail (p > 0.05). The meal reduced (p < 0.0001) the number of eggs laid but did not affect external and internal egg quality (p > 0.05). Dietary fortification with HSCM at 10% significantly reduced the egg fat content but increased linoleic acid and arachidonic acid (p < 0.05) content. Although H. sabdariffa calyces meal increased egg nutritional value, its use as a dietary supplement in laying hens may result in reduced productivity affecting profitability.","Animals; Coturnix; Animal Feed; Hibiscus; Diet; Female; Eggs; Random Allocation; Dietary Supplements; Ovum; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Food, Fortified"

Antidepressants exert an influence on measures of gut microbial diversity. The most consistently reported differences were in β-diversity between those exposed to antidepressants and those not exposed, with longitudinal studies supporting a potential causal association. Compositional alterations in antidepressant users include an increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum, Christensenellaceae family, and Bacteroides and Clostridium genera, while a decrease was found in the Firmicutes phylum, Ruminococcaceae family, and Ruminococcus genus. In addition, antidepressants attenuate gut microbial differences between depressed and healthy individuals, modulate microbial serotonin transport, and influence microbiota's metabolic functions. These include lyxose degradation, peptidoglycan maturation, membrane transport, and methylerythritol phosphate pathways, alongside gamma-aminobutyric acid metabolism. Importantly, baseline increased α-diversity and abundance of the Roseburia and Faecalibacterium genera, in the Firmicutes phylum, are associated with antidepressant response, emerging as promising biomarkers. This review highlights the potential for gut microbiota as a predictor of treatment response and emphasizes the need for further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying antidepressant-microbiota interactions. More homogeneous studies and standardized techniques are required to confirm these initial findings.",Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Antidepressive Agents; Treatment Outcome

Alopecia in wildlife has been linked to multiple possible factors and often is a sign of suboptimal health. In 2023, we designed an experiment to compare prevalence of alopecia in gray bats across various reproductive stages, characterize the severity of alopecia lesions, and determine the ectoparasites and microbiota present on the regions of fur loss. We harp-trapped four summer gray bat roosts 2-3 times between 11 April-30 August 2023 and collected skin swabs and scrapes from each bat with alopecia. We determined the severity of the alopecia lesions on a scale 0-7 by summing the degree of redness (0-2), skin condition (0-1), and percentage of fur loss (0-4). We cultured the skin swabs for fungal and bacterial growth and examined skin scrapes under a microscope to determine the presence of subcutaneous mites. We found no evidence that subcutaneous mites cause the fur loss. We determined that prevalence of alopecia in M. grisescens varies throughout the summer. Prevalence is highest for female bats that are or recently were lactating, reaching an average of 6% ± 6 SD (0-15% range) of captured females exhibiting fur loss during the pup rearing period. Alopecia is most prevalent in male bats in early summer (1% ± 2 SD; 0-4% range). Lactating females had more severe cases than males and were often associated with skin redness due to unknown causes. Bats with alopecia did not differ in body condition, determined from body mass, from bats without alopecia. Future studies could investigate the role of stress in possible autoimmune responses contributing to alopecia. Conservation strategies aimed at reducing stress and supporting nutritional requirements during the summer are likely beneficial to M. grisescens.",Animals; Chiroptera; Alopecia; Female; Lactation; Prevalence; Male; Seasons; Skin; Mites
39621667,bananas,4641,,,Specific PCR primer designed from genome data for rapid detection of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense tropical race 4 in the Cavendish banana.,"Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) tropical race 4 (TR4) severely affects banana production worldwide. Thus, specific PCR primers have been developed to rapidly diagnose and monitor Foc TR4-related fusarium wilt outbreaks in bananas. However, evaluation of these primers revealed room for improvement in the accuracy. This study aimed to design highly specific PCR primers based on genome data for Foc TR4 downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. The specificity of the primers was assessed using Foc TR4, Foc races 1 and 2, and 15 other formae speciales strains. The utility of the primers was verified by correctly detecting Foc TR4 in 7 out of 86 isolates of Fusarium spp. obtained from banana farms in the Philippines. The primers allowed for rapid detection in experimentally diseased tissues. We concluded that this novel primer set enables the simplified diagnosis of fusarium wilt caused by Foc TR4 in bananas.","Fusarium; Musa; Plant Diseases; DNA Primers; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Genome, Fungal"

Here, we established a zebrafish in vivo model of ZIKV infection to circumvent limitations of existing mammalian models. Leveraging the unique tractability of this system, we gained unprecedented access to the ZIKV-infected brain at early developmental stages. The infection of zebrafish larvae with ZIKV phenocopied the disease in mammals including a reduced head area and neural progenitor cells (NPC) infection and depletion. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses of NPCs isolated from ZIKV-infected embryos revealed a distinct dysregulation of genes involved in survival and neuronal differentiation, including downregulation of the expression of the glutamate transporter vglut1, resulting in an altered glutamatergic network in the brain. Mechanistically, ectopic expression of ZIKV protein NS4A in the larvae recapitulated the morphological defects observed in infected animals, identifying NS4A as a key determinant of neurovirulence and a promising antiviral target for developing therapies.","Animals; Zebrafish; Zika Virus Infection; Zika Virus; Disease Models, Animal; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Neurogenesis; Neural Stem Cells; Brain; Humans; Neurons"
39621795,Zika virus,64320,SRP54,6729,Flaviviruses induce ER-specific remodelling of protein synthesis.,"Flaviviruses orchestrate a unique remodelling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to facilitate translation and processing of their polyprotein, giving rise to virus replication compartments. While the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent pathway is the canonical route for ER-targeting of nascent cellular membrane proteins, it is unknown whether flaviviruses rely on this mechanism. Here we show that Zika virus bypasses the SRP receptor via extensive interactions between the viral non-structural proteins and the host translational machinery. Remarkably, Zika virus appears to maintain ER-localised translation via NS3-SRP54 interaction instead, unlike other viruses such as influenza. Viral proteins engage SRP54 and the translocon, selectively enriching for factors supporting membrane expansion and lipid metabolism while excluding RNA binding and antiviral stress granule proteins. Our findings reveal a sophisticated viral strategy to rewire host protein synthesis pathways and create a replication-favourable subcellular niche, providing insights into viral adaptation.",Endoplasmic Reticulum; Humans; Zika Virus; Protein Biosynthesis; Virus Replication; Zika Virus Infection; Flavivirus; Signal Recognition Particle
39621906,pea,252690,,,Opportunities and challenges of plant proteins as functional ingredients for food production.,"Consumer interest in meat and dairy alternatives drives demand for plant-based protein ingredients. While soy and gluten dominate the market, there is a trend to explore alternative crops for functional ingredient production. The multitude of ingredients poses challenges for food manufacturers in selecting the right protein. We investigated 61 commercially available protein ingredients from various sources, categorizing them based on their protein content into protein-rich flours (protein content less than 50%), protein concentrates (protein content between 50% and 80%), and protein isolates (protein content higher than 80%). Methionine, cysteine, and lysine were decisive for the amino acid score, which even varied between ingredients produced from the same raw material. Such differences were also observed in the protein solubility profiles, characterized by their raw material-specific protein pattern. By focusing on soy, pea, and fava bean ingredients, the broad spectra of emulsifying and foaming properties were illustrated. These ranged from non-emulsifying and non-foaming to high emulsifying capacities of 737 mL/g ingredient and foaming activities of 2,278%, accompanied by a foam stability of 100%. Additionally, we demonstrated that the functionality of ingredients obtained from different batches could vary by up to 24% relative SD. Protein solubility, powder wettability, color, and particle size were determined as key properties for the differentiation of soy, pea, and fava bean protein ingredients by principal component analysis. In our study conclusion, we propose essential measures for overcoming challenges in protein ingredient production and utilization to realize their full potential in fostering sustainable and innovative plant-based food production.",Plant Proteins; Solubility; Amino Acids; Flour; Vicia faba; Functional Food; Glycine max; Food Ingredients
39621907,peas,3888,,,"A multicriteria analysis of meat and milk alternatives from nutritional, health, environmental, and cost perspectives.","Reducing meat and dairy intake has been identified as a necessary strategy for mitigating the high environmental impacts food systems are currently having on climate change, biodiversity loss associated with land-use changes, and freshwater use. Having a choice of dedicated meat and milk replacements available to consumers can help in the transition toward more plant-based diets, but concerns about nutritional and health impacts and high costs can impede uptake. Here, we conduct a multicriteria assessment of 24 meat and milk alternatives that integrates nutritional, health, environmental, and cost analyses with a focus on high-income countries. Unprocessed plant-based foods such as peas, soybeans, and beans performed best in our assessment across all domains. In comparison, processed plant-based products such as veggie burgers, traditional meat replacements such as tempeh, and plant milks were associated with less climate benefits and greater costs than unprocessed foods but still offered substantial environmental, health, and nutritional benefits compared to animal products. Our findings suggest that a range of food products exist that when replacing meat and dairy in current diets would have multiple benefits, including reductions in nutritional imbalances, dietary risks and mortality, environmental resource use and pollution, and when choosing unprocessed foods over processed ones also diet costs. The findings provide support for public policies and business initiatives aimed at increasing their uptake.","Animals; Milk; Humans; Meat; Nutritive Value; Environment; Climate Change; Costs and Cost Analysis; Diet, Vegetarian"
39622652,Acanthamoeba,5755,,,Identification of essential genes for Acanthamoeba castellanii excystation during encystation and excystation.,"Acanthamoeba is an opportunistic pathogen that causes Acanthamoeba keratitis, granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, and other cutaneous diseases. The life cycle of Acanthamoeba consists of 2 stages of trophozoites and cysts. Under adverse environmental conditions, Acanthamoeba encysts, while the conditions become favorable for growth, it reverts to the trophozoite form. Acanthamoeba excystation is crucial for its proliferation and can lead to recurrent infections after incomplete treatment. To identify the factors involved in excystation, A. castellanii was subjected to either encystation- or excystation-inducing conditions, and gene expression profiles were compared using mRNA sequencing. A. castellanii samples were collected at 8 h intervals for analysis under both conditions. Differentially expressed gene analysis revealed that 1,214 and 1,163 genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, by more than 2-fold during early excystation. Five genes markedly upregulated in early excystation (ACA1_031140, ACA1_032330, ACA1_374400, ACA1_275740, and ACA1_112650) were selected, and their expression levels were confirmed via real-time PCR. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting these 5 genes was transfected into Acanthamoeba and gene knockdown was validated through real-time PCR. The silencing of ACA1_031140, ACA1_032330, ACA1_374400, and ACA1_112650 inhibited excystation and suggested that these genes might be essential for excystation.

The characteristic surface ultrastructures such as tegument with transverse striations, genital atrium, genital pore, and opisthaptor with numerous clamps were observed. The worms were firmly attached to the gill lamellae using clamps from the opisthaptor, causing gill damage and degeneration. The distal part of the lamellae was ruptured by the sclerites of the clamps. The histopathological examination revealed epithelial hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and occasionally fusion of the lamellae.

However, during the preparation for commercialization of those species, they suffer the process known as ""finning"" which includes removing and separating the head, arm, skin or even having the body structure cut into rings, which ends up making it difficult or often prevents the identification of the species, which can lead to replacements. In this sense, the present study aimed to use the large ribosomal region, rrnL (16S rDNA) to genetically identify cephalopod species sold in markets and fairs in Latin America. Whole and processed samples were collected from supermarkets and directly from local fishers the approximate collection location. Each generated sequence was submitted to the blastn portal for molecular comparison and included in the database for subsequent genetic identification. Our results indicate labeling errors in samples from the State of Pará that contained the species Dosidicus gigas found only in the Pacific Ocean and were generically labeled as ""National Lula"". No type of substitution was found among the samples that were being sold at fairs and markets, only labeling errors. Thus, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the rrnL for identifying species and evaluating labeling errors.","Animals; Latin America; Decapodiformes; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Phylogeny"

We analyzed archival diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from mother- (MR) or nursery-reared (NR) chimpanzees and used support vector machine learning to determine whether we could retrospectively classify chimpanzees as MR or NR based on white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) decades after their rearing experiences. A significant proportion of chimpanzees were correctly classified as MR and NR based on white matter fractional anisotropy (76.32%; p = 0.004). Voxel-based morphometry revealed that MR chimpanzees had increased FA in the splenium/isthmus of the corpus collosum and premotor cortex, while NR chimpanzees had increased FA in the thalamic region, cuneus, and lateral genu of the corpus collosum (p < 0.01). A subset of the NR chimpanzees participated in early social interventions, but unlike gray matter, these interventions do not explain misclassification based on white matter. These findings suggest that nursery rearing has long-term effects on both gray and white matter, but that early interventions may ameliorate the effects on gray matter only.

We previously found that Aedes aegypti third-instar larvae cleared of their microbiota were impaired in their development, notably due to a lack of folic acid (vitamin B9). In this study, we found that diet supplementation using a cocktail of seven B vitamins did not improve mosquito developmental success, but rather had a significant impact on the sex-ratio of the resulting adults, with an enrichment of female mosquitoes emerging from B vitamin-treated larvae. A transcriptomic analysis of male and female larvae identified some sex-specific regulated genes upon vitamin treatment. When treating germ-free larvae with individual B vitamins, we detected a specific toxic effect related to biotin (vitamin B7) exposure at high concentrations. We then provided germ-free larvae with varying biotin doses and showed that males are sensitive to biotin toxicity at a lower concentration than females. Gnotobiotic larvae exposed to controlled low bacterial counts or with bacteria characterised by slower growth, show a male-enriched adult population, suggesting that males require less bacteria-derived nutrients than females. These findings indicate that during larval development, mosquitoes have sex-specific nutritional requirements and toxicity thresholds, which impact the sex ratio of adults.",Animals; Aedes; Female; Male; Sex Ratio; Larva; Vitamin B Complex; Biotin; Bacteria

While the properties of NMR cultured fibroblasts have been extensively studied and have revealed several unusual features of this cancer-resistant, long-lived species, comparative DMR studies are extremely limited. We optimized conditions for successfully culturing primary DMR skin fibroblasts and also established immortalized DMR cells using simian virus 40 early region expression. Like NMRs, DMR fibroblasts are more resistant than mice to various cytotoxins including heavy metals, DNA-damaging agents, oxidative stressors, and proteasome inhibitors. DMR genome sequencing analyses revealed the presence of premature stop codons in the master regulator genes of necroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death-receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), although these mutations have different locations to those found in the NMR. DMR cells, like NMR cells, did not show significantly increased cell death in response to necroptosis induction. Our data suggest that both Bathyergid species require species-specific cell culture conditions for optimized growth, display similar resistance to cytotoxins, and show loss-of-function mutations abrogating the ability to employ necroptosis. These shared traits may contribute to their evolved adaptations to their subterranean lifestyle and prolonged longevity. These convergent insights and valuable resource may be pertinent to biomedical research.","Animals; Mole Rats; Fibroblasts; Necroptosis; Mice; Longevity; Cells, Cultured"

In this study, ST65-KL2 and ST11-KL64 hypervirulent and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (hvCRKP) were identified from two different outbreak cases: (1) clonal spreading of ST65-KL2 in five patients within transplantation wards spanning three months; and (2) clonal transmission of ST11-KL64 in ten patients across 10 months. The representative strains of ST65-KL2 and ST11-KL64 hvCRKP, K22877 and K56649, produced carbapenemase NDM-5 and dual carbapenemases KPC-2 and NDM-13, respectively, and both exhibited high-level carbapenem resistance. Moreover, virulent analysis showed that K22877 and K56649 were hypervirulent and the former possessed stronger virulence. Evolutionary pathways suggested ST65-KL2 and ST11-KL64 hvCRKP could be classified as CR-hvKP (hvKP acquiring carbapenem resistance) and hv-CRKP (CRKP acquiring hypervirulence), respectively. Unexpectedly, ST65-KL2 CR-hvKP showed resistance to ciprofloxacin mediated by plasmid acquisition as its spread, and ST11-KL64 hv-CRKP developed into enhanced virulence and macrophage resistance.

39623412,equine,9796,IL-10,100034187,Differential modulation of inflammatory cytokines by recombinant IL-10 in IL-1β and TNF-α ̶ stimulated equine chondrocytes and synoviocytes: impact of washing and timing on cytokine responses.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) remains a challenging joint disorder necessitating effective anti-inflammatory interventions. In this study, our primary objective was to establish an in vitro protocol that replicates the clinical investigation of anti-inflammatory drugs intended for OA management. Focusing on recombinant IL-10 (r.IL-10) as a potential anti-inflammatory treatment, we designed and implemented two distinct protocols to evaluate the efficacy of r.IL-10 in modulating chondrocyte and synoviocyte inflammation.The experimental design involved sequential stimulation with IL-1β and TNF-α for 24 h, followed by washing (model 1) or not washing (model 2) the cells before r.IL-10 treatment. Samples were collected after 6-24 h of treatment. Cellular responses were evaluated by quantifying gene expression and synthesis of key inflammatory cytokines and proteases.The expression and synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and proteases was significantly affected by washing and treatment time. The expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-8, MMP-13, and ADAMTS5 were effectively reduced in r.IL-10-treated chondrocytes and synoviocytes in model 2 after 24 h, particularly at concentrations of 10 and 20 ng/mL. r.IL-10 treatment significantly increased IL-6 gene expression in chondrocytes at all time points. However, in synoviocytes, IL-6 expression was significantly lower in model 2 after 24 h of r.IL-10 treatment. r.IL-10 treatment significantly decreased IL-1β and TNF-α content in synoviocyte supernatants, particularly in model 2 at concentrations of 10 and 20 ng/mL after 6 and 24 h. r.IL-10 treatment in chondrocytes led to a significant decrease in IL-1β supernatant concentrations in model 2 after 24 h only.This study demonstrated that r.IL-10 treatment effectively reduces key inflammatory markers and matrix metalloproteinase activity in both chondrocytes and synoviocytes, particularly in model 2 where cells were not washed prior to treatment. These findings highlight r.IL-10's potential as a robust anti-inflammatory agent for OA management and suggest its critical role in developing effective therapeutic strategies for OA.","Animals; Chondrocytes; Horses; Interleukin-1beta; Synoviocytes; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Interleukin-10; Cytokines; Recombinant Proteins; Cells, Cultured; Anti-Inflammatory Agents"

39624499,tobacco,4097,,,Analysis of the key component puff-by-puff transport in special segments and aerosol for electrical heated tobacco product.,"Understanding the puff-by-puff delivery mechanisms of key components of heated tobacco products is critical to developing product designs. This study investigates the puff-by-puff release patterns of key components in Natural Smoke Cigarettes (NSCs), which are designed to deliver nicotine without combustion by reducing oxygen content, utilizing a 30-s puff interval, a 2-s puff duration, and a 55 mL puff volume to simulate realistic smoking conditions. By establishing models to analyze the variation of nicotine, glycerol, 1,2-propylene glycol (PG), and water in different functional sections of the cigarette under controlled smoking conditions. These sections include the tobacco, hollow, cooling, and filter sections, constituting the structure of NSCs. In addition, the model calculates the port-by-port release of the components in the flue gas aerosol and compares it with the measured value. The results showed that: The retention amount in the tobacco section showed a steep decline in the first three puffs, with an overall exponential decrease. The amounts in the other sections were consistent, increasing in the first two puffs and then stabilizing. The retention amount decreased linearly with each puff, with a similar pattern across sections. The release amount peaked at the fourth to fifth puffs and then stabilized. The retention amount in the tobacco section declined exponentially in the first three puffs. It peaked in the second to third puffs in other sections, then decreased with each subsequent puff. The retention amount in the tobacco section showed a significant decline in the first puff, stabilizing at around 4 mg. In other sections, it peaked at the first puff and then rapidly declined. These findings can inform the development of reduced-harm smoking products and contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of smoke generation. Additionally, the study offers a reference for the puff-by-puff release stability of NSCs and the improvement of consumers' sensory quality.",

39624662,European beech,28930,,,High spatial and spectral resolution dataset of hyperspectral look-up tables for 3.5 million traits and structural combinations of Central European temperate broadleaf forests.,"Accurate retrieval of forest functional traits from remote sensing data is critical for monitoring forest health and productivity. To achieve sufficient accuracy using inverse methods it is essential to have representative database of simulated or measured spectral properties together with corresponding forest traits. However, existing datasets are often limited in scope, covering specific sites and times with simplified structures. This limitation hinders the development of generalizable machine learning models for trait prediction. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive high-resolution dataset of hyperspectral Look-Up Tables (LUT) designed for Central European temperate broadleaf forests. The dataset includes 3.5 million unique combinations of leaf biochemical and canopy structural characteristics of forest scenes together with a variety of sun geometry. The spectral data cover wavelengths from 450 nm to 2300 nm, with a resolution of 2 nm. The dataset is organised into two files: one capturing the average reflectance of all scene pixels and another focusing solely on sunlit leaf pixels. LUT were generated using the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer model version 5.10.0. Virtual forest scenes were based on 3D tree representations derived from Terrestrial Laser Scanning of European beech trees, adjusted to various leaf area index values and structural configurations to simulate natural forest variability. The reflectance data were processed using MATLAB and Python scripts, resulting in hyperspectral cubes that were processed to generate the LUT. The dataset can be used to train machine learning models, such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, for predicting forest functional traits and assisting in the calibration of remote sensing algorithms. The biggest advantage of the dataset is high spectral and spatial resolution, together with the high number of different trait combinations, which allows for adaptability to different times, locations, and hyper- and multispectral sensors, and can support up-coming hyperspectral satellite missions. ESA Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment (CHIME) and NASA Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) future satellite missions can utilise this dataset to develop their product processors for monitoring forest traits.",

39625433,Epstein-Barr virus,10376,,,One step 4× and 12× 3D-ExM enables robust super-resolution microscopy of nanoscale cellular structures.,"Super-resolution microscopy has become an indispensable tool across diverse research fields, offering unprecedented insights into biological architectures with nanometer scale resolution. Compared with traditional nanometer-scale imaging methods such as electron microscopy, super-resolution microscopy offers several advantages, including the simultaneous labeling of multiple target biomolecules with high specificity and simpler sample preparation, making it accessible to most researchers. In this study, we introduce two optimized methods of super-resolution imaging: 4-fold and 12-fold 3D-isotropic and preserved Expansion Microscopy (4× and 12× 3D-ExM). 3D-ExM is a straightforward expansion microscopy technique featuring a single-step process, providing robust and reproducible 3D isotropic expansion for both 2D and 3D cell culture models. With standard confocal microscopy, 12× 3D-ExM achieves a lateral resolution of <30 nm, enabling the visualization of nanoscale structures, including chromosomes, kinetochores, nuclear pore complexes, and Epstein-Barr virus particles. These results demonstrate that 3D-ExM provides cost-effective and user-friendly super-resolution microscopy, making it highly suitable for a wide range of cell biology research, including studies on cellular and chromatin architectures.","Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Nuclear Pore; Kinetochores; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Microscopy, Confocal; HeLa Cells; Chromosomes; Microscopy, Fluorescence"

Medical records, hematologic results, surgical reports, and histopathologic results from 182 dogs that underwent splenectomy for the treatment of splenic masses or nodules were reviewed retrospectively. The majority of dogs (57.7%) had benign splenic diagnoses with no malignancy. Hemangiosarcoma was diagnosed in 32.4% of the dogs. A final multivariable model indicated that thrombocytopenia, anemia, and a smaller diameter of the largest splenic nodule were risk factors for hemangiosarcoma (P<0.001), and hemoperitoneum (P = 0.01) was an additional risk factor when nodule diameter was not evaluated. There were 91 dogs that had hemoperitoneum, and 60.4% of those dogs had malignant splenic lesions. Of the 33 dogs that underwent a splenectomy for incidentally identified splenic lesions, 93.9% had benign splenic lesions.

While most studies have focused on long-term, seasonal phenological shifts, the effect of warming on short-term phenological match-mismatch in these interactions remains unclear. Here, we investigate how experimental warming affects within-day foraging behavior of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and plant anthesis, and whether the resulting changes in bee pollen composition, in terms of the relative abundance of pollen from different plant species, influences larval development. Experimental warming advanced both the within-day foraging by bees and anthesis of Bidens pilosa-the predominant pollen source among all plant species represented in the collected pollen. Through experimental manipulation of pollen composition, we demonstrated that an increased proportion of B. pilosa pollen in the diet enhanced bee larval growth efficiency. Overall, our study demonstrates that warming may influence pollinator interactions with the many plant species by affecting pollinator behaviors and plant anthesis on short-term temporal scales, with potential implications for pollinator larval development.",Animals; Bees; Larva; Pollination; Pollen

39616195,TBEV,11084,NS5,5894,Multi-protomics analysis identified host cellular pathways perturbed by tick-borne encephalitis virus infection.,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) represents a pivotal tick-transmitted flavivirus responsible for severe neurological consequences in Europe and Asia. The emergence of TBEV genetic mutations and vaccine-breakthrough infections, along with the absence of effective vaccines and specific drugs for other tick-borne flaviviruses associated with severe encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever, underscores the urgent need for progress in understanding the pathogenesis and intervention strategies for TBEV and related flaviviruses. Here we elucidate cellular alterations in the proteome, phosphoproteome, and acetylproteome upon TBEV infection. Our findings reveal a substantial impact of TBEV infection on the innate immune response, ribosomal biogenesis, autophagy, and DNA damage response (DDR). Mechanically, the non-structural protein NS5 of TBEV impedes DNA damage repair by interacting with SIRT1 to suppress the deacetylation of KAP1 and Ku70. Additionally, the precursor membrane protein prM induces autophagy via associating with AKT1 while constrains autolysosome formation through binding to VPS11. Inhibitors targeting DDR, as well as specific kinases, exhibit potent antiviral activity, suggesting the dysregulated pathways and kinases as potential targets for antiviral intervention. These results from our study contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis and offers insights for developing effective antiviral drugs against TBEV and other tick-borne flaviviruses.","Encephalitis Viruses, Tick-Borne; Humans; Autophagy; Encephalitis, Tick-Borne; Animals; Immunity, Innate; Proteome; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; DNA Damage; Phosphoproteins; Antiviral Agents; Proteomics"

Building on our previous research, we employed a co-infection model with Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) to investigate the pharmacological action of Radix Isatidis Mixtures (RIM). To further demonstrate the various mechanisms underlying the pharmacological effects of RIM, we conducted a validation study focusing on gene expression, protein interactions, metabolic pathways, and molecular docking. Through a multi-omics joint analysis network, we identified key targets and metabolites associated with co-infection and conducted targeted verification experiments with RIM aqueous extracts. The experimental results indicated that, compared to the co-infection group, the RIM treatment group significantly modulated the expression of select genes and proteins, particularly MMP2 and TLR4, with a high level of statistical significance (p < 0.01). At the metabolic level, the treatment group exhibited significantly reduced expression levels of Dopamine and γ-Aminobutyric acid. Notably, the molecular docking results highlighted compounds with the most favorable binding affinities: Salvianolic acid A (-10.1 kcal/mol), Licorice (-9.3 kcal/mol), and Isoglycyrrhiza (-8.7 kcal/mol). In conclusion, our multi-level experiments demonstrated that RIM possesses the characteristics of multi-pathway and multi-target treatment for co-infection.","Mycoplasma gallisepticum; Animals; Poultry Diseases; Mycoplasma Infections; Escherichia coli Infections; Escherichia coli; Coinfection; Chickens; Molecular Docking Simulation; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Plant Extracts"

39617747,potato,4113,,,Recyclable and non-recyclable packaging films with different barrier properties: Effect of processing and storage time on quality of mashed potato and ground carrot.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate if high barrier recyclable material polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol (PE/EVOH) can be an alternative non-recyclable polyamides (PA)/PE laminate and also if high barrier is required or recyclable PE material with low barrier properties is good enough to maintain the quality of thermally processed mashed potato and ground carrot. The oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of the PA/PE and PE films decreased after heat treatment, while no change was observed for PE/EVOH films. Food contact did not impact the OTR of PA/PE and PE/EVOH films, while the OTR of PE films decreased. The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of PA/PE and PE/EVOH films increased after heat treatment. In general, the WVTR of films increased after food contact. The tensile strength of all films was only reduced up to 3-4 weeks of food contact. After 10 weeks, the PE film showed significantly lower hue values and a larger total color difference than the two other films. Light exposure reduced the hue values and increased total color difference after 6 weeks of storage. The odor and flavor of both mashed potatoes and ground carrots were affected by light exposure. The mashed potato showed a slight reduction in freshness-odor for all materials with storage time. For flavor, mashed potato and ground carrot showed similar trends; flavor was scored unacceptable when packaged in PE films after 6 weeks, but when packaged in PA/PE and PE/EVOH films, the flavor was still acceptable after 10 weeks of storage.",Food Packaging; Solanum tuberosum; Daucus carota; Food Storage; Food Handling; Tensile Strength; Recycling; Taste; Polyvinyls; Odorants; Polyethylene; Color

Here, we conducted a pilot study aiming to strengthen rabies surveillance by combining community-based surveillance with field-based diagnostic testing in pastoral and agro-pastoral communities in central Kenya; communities which are frequently marginalised from health systems. During the 6-month pilot study, there were 14 alerts of suspected rabid dogs in the community, of which eight were tested and five diagnostically confirmed as rabid. Two positive samples processed successfully for whole genome sequencing indicated that the rabies variant circulating in central Kenya during the study period belonged to the Africa 1b subclade, which is similar to variants identified in eastern Kenya and Tanzania, suggesting regional transmission. This pilot study indicates that rabies continues to circulate in the region and that community-based surveillance, when combined with enhanced diagnostic testing, can help alleviate underreporting and guide vaccination campaigns.",Kenya; Rabies; Animals; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Pilot Projects; Rural Population; Humans; Rabies virus; Epidemiological Monitoring; Rabies Vaccines; Population Surveillance

Utilizing data from the Fisheries Statistical Yearbook, three scenarios were employed to assess the effects of highly migratory, oceanic migratory, and seasonal migratory fish species on the MTL and FiB indices. The analysis revealed a continuous increase in MTL for offshore and coastal fisheries, suggesting shifts in the trophic structure and potential over-exploitation of higher trophic level species. The FiB index for offshore fisheries exhibited a declining pattern after 1990, reflecting the depletion of indigenous fish stocks, while the FiB for coastal fisheries showed an increasing trend from 1970 until the 2000s, followed by a decrease, highlighting unsustainable fishing practices.

In this regard, dried cumin seeds were collected from four different locations (SaadatShahr (P1) and Sarvestan (P2) from Fars Province and Kashmar (P3) and Sabzevar (P4) from Khorasan), and their essential oils were isolated by Clevenger apparatus and evaluated using GC and GC-MS. In addition, the hypnotic and antinociceptive activities of the cumin EO sample, which had the highest yield and quality, respectively, were assessed via the pentobarbital-induced loss of righting test and acetic acid-induced writhing test. Our results showed that the highest amount of EO was present in sample P4 (3.63%), followed by P3 (2.92%), P2 (2.69%), and P1 (2.31%). GC-MS analysis revealed cuminaldehyde (21.31-33.60%), γ-terpinene (13.68-23.29%), p-mentha-1,4-dien-7-al (14.44-20.84%), p-mentha-1,3-dien-7-al (10.06-14.02%), β-pinene (9.32-11.46%), and p-cymene (3.16-7.89%) were the major constituents in all the populations.

39619960,sweet potato,4120,,,Ultrasonic-assisted extraction of nanocellulose from sweet potato residue and its application in noodles.,"Enhancing the amount of dietary fiber without compromising the quality of noodles remains a challenge in the food industry. This study aimed to optimize the ultrasound-assisted extraction parameters to enhance the yield of nanocellulose from sweet potato residue (SPR) using a response surface methodology. The impact of SPR nanocellulose on noodles' physicochemical properties was also explored. Results showed that the optimal extraction conditions for nanocellulose from SPR were identified as 180.73 U/mL cellulase concentration, 4.28 h ultrasonic time, 444.12 W ultrasonic power, and 14.17 h enzymatic hydrolysis time. The max yield of nanocellulose was 15.93% at optimum extraction conditions. Increasing the amount of SPR nanocellulose resulted in a reduction in the optimal cooking time, water absorption, elongation index, and springiness, as well as an increase in the breaking rate, cooking loss, hardness, gumminess, and chewiness of the noodles. Sensory analysis revealed higher acceptability of the noodles with 6%-12% SPR nanocellulose compared to other treatments. Microstructure demonstrated that noodles with 0%-18% SPR nanocellulose exhibited fewer holes and denser network structures, but higher SPR nanocellulose damaged the protein network. Those findings suggested that noodles with less than 12% SPR nanocellulose exhibited higher quality. This research provided the foundation for the development of nanocellulose-enriched foods.",

39620008,bacteria,629395,,,The strategic role of biotics in dental caries prevention: A scoping review.,"Dental caries is a global oral health issue that is prevalent and preventable. Biotics (probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, and postbiotics) are recommended as low-cost methods for preventing dental caries. This scoping review aimed to critically review the scientific evidence concerning the role of biotics in caries prevention and maintaining oral health benefits. A systematic search was conducted in several databases from 2012 onward, using specific keywords. The search resulted in 69 articles. While there is limited research on the mechanism of biotics in preventing caries, numerous studies have investigated the impacts of probiotics on decreasing caries risk factors. Probiotics can reduce cariogenic bacteria, reduce acidogenic bacteria, increase pH, and produce antimicrobial compounds. Probiotics can be used as a therapeutic approach to manage caries by restoring eubiosis at the host-microbial interface, which may not be accomplished with traditional therapies. Its positive effect on reducing dental caries is influenced by the choice of potent probiotic strains, appropriate dosage, treatment period, vehicle, and microbial interaction with the host. Specific oral bacteria have also been shown to utilize prebiotics such as urea and arginine, increasing pH levels. This highlights the potential of combining prebiotic and probiotic bacteria for caries prevention. In addition, this review is focused on bacterial-derived compounds, namely postbiotics, due to their valuable effects in preventing caries. Biotics have demonstrated potential in preventing dental caries and maintaining oral health. Further research is needed to optimize their use and explore the potential of postbiotics for caries prevention.",
39620011,broccoli,36774,,,Optimizing Grape Quality Through Tillage and Organic Fertilization: A Comprehensive Analysis of Phenolic and Anthocyanin Variability Over Three Years.,"Knowing the concentration levels of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins in grape berries plays a key role, as these compounds significantly contribute to the nutritional value and quality of grapes, affecting both health benefits and grape quality. The current study was conducted to investigate how different tillage (disc harrow, chisel, no tillage) and organic fertilizer (Antep radish and broccoli chopped residue, olive blackwater) treatments affect the concentration of these valuable compounds in Royal grape berries over three consecutive years (2020-2022), providing insights into optimal agricultural practices for enhancing grape quality. Our results documented significant variations in phenolic and anthocyanin concentrations across different soil tillage, organic fertilizer treatments and years. Among the soil treatments, the disc harrow treatment emerged as the most effective in increasing the levels of most phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, while the broccoli fertilizer treatment was identified as the superior fertilizer application for achieving the same goal. Excluding disc harrow and broccoli fertilizer treatments, other treatments such as no tillage and chisel tillage, and fertilizers like olive blackwater and Antep radish, showed variable effectiveness. These treatments, although less effective overall than the leading treatments, contributed to increased levels of certain compounds such as resveratrol and pterostilbene, indicating their specific benefits. The findings also indicated specific combinations of tillage and fertilizer treatments that maximized the accumulation of certain phenolic compounds, like the combination of no tillage with broccoli fertilizer, which was particularly effective in increasing the levels of vanillic acid and ",

In the case of jujube pectin, cytotoxic effects were observed at all concentrations except for 1.2 mg/mL.",
39620051,HPV,10566,,,Is it ethical for immunisations against human papillomavirus to be mandatory in young people aged 12-13 years old?,"The discussion surrounding the ethics of mandatory HPV vaccination for young adolescents aged 12-13 is complex. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection with certain strains linked to cervical and other types of cancers. While screening and behavioural interventions play important roles in prevention, vaccination has been shown to provide superior protection, thus reducing the incidence of HPV-related diseases by up to 90%. The effectiveness of the HPV vaccine, particularly Gardasil9, has led to discussions about making vaccination mandatory to improve public health outcomes. However, this raises ethical concerns about parental rights, individual autonomy and the implications of mandating vaccination in the context of sexual behaviour. This paper explores the ethical implications of a mandatory HPV vaccination programme, focusing on the ethical concerns of parental rights, gender equity and socioeconomic disparities. Additionally, the paper considers barriers to vaccination uptake and emphasises the importance of education and informed consent. It will be further discussed that while mandatory vaccination could lead to substantial public health benefits, it must be balanced by respecting individual freedoms and be accompanied by education campaigns. Ultimately, the ethical justification for mandatory HPV vaccination lies in its potential to prevent significant harm and promote health equity across populations.",

39621533,Methanosaeta,2222,,,Influence of inoculum-to-substrate ratio on biomethane production via anaerobic digestion of biomass.,"The influence of the inoculum-to-substrate ratio (ISR) on anaerobic digestion (AD) of biomass in terms of methane yield and microbial community, was explored in this paper. The level of ISR can affect the AD performance in several ways. At extremely low ISR, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumuate, while inhibition occur at higher level of ISR. An ISR ranging from 1.0-2.0 was found optimal resulting in higher methane yield, organic matter removal and VFA degradation. Furthermore, a high ISR (2.0-4.0) is favourable to methanogenesis, while a lower ISR (<1.0) is prone to irreversible acidification. The range of ISR can shift the methanogenic pathway of AD to favour an acetoclastic or hydrogenotrophic response, indicated by the enriched group of microorganisms. The genus Methanosaeta (acetoclastic) and Methanobacterium (hydrogenotrophic) are the most enriched methanogens across all ISRs, while Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetae are dominant in the bacterial community. Additionally, the interplay of substrate biodegradability and ISR potentially affects AD performance. Finally, novel equations are developed and proposed for characterizing the quantity of inoculum and substrate.","Methane; Anaerobiosis; Biomass; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Bacteria; Bioreactors"
39621595,medfly,7213,,,Exploring the metabolic changes of Ceratitis capitata Vienna 8 strain across three developmental stages through probiotic larval diet supplementation.,"The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is revolutionizing pest control through its environmentally friendly approach, which involves rearing and sterilizing male insect pests using ionizing radiation and subsequently releasing them into the field to mate with wild females without producing offspring. Recent research has unveiled a groundbreaking enhancement in the quality of released Ceratitis capitata (medfly) males through the addition of probiotics to their larval diet. To thoroughly examine the impact of probiotic supplementation on the medfly larval diet, we conducted an in-depth analysis with GC-MS from medfly extract supplemented with probiotic Enterobacter sp. strain. The supplementation revealed a notable difference in the metabolomic signature compared to non-supplemented extract across all medfly life stages. We identified 37 known metabolites for all the stages, 12 of them were identified as biomarkers for the larval stage, 12 for the pupal stage, and 13 for the adult stage exhibiting crucial activities such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and sexual and aggregation pheromone. These findings underscore the considerable potential of SIT combined with probiotic supplementation for enhancing sustainable pest control strategies worldwide.","Animals; Ceratitis capitata; Larva; Probiotics; Male; Dietary Supplements; Female; Pest Control, Biological; Enterobacter; Diet; Metabolomics; Pupa; Metabolome"
39621765,Trypanosoma brucei,5691,,,Molecular characterization of the permanent outer-inner membrane contact site of the mitochondrial genome segregation complex in trypanosomes.,"The parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei has a single unit mitochondrial genome linked to the basal body of the flagellum via the tripartite attachment complex (TAC). The TAC is crucial for mitochondrial genome segregation during cytokinesis. At the core of the TAC, the outer membrane protein TAC60 binds to the inner membrane protein p166, forming a permanent contact site between the two membranes. Although contact sites between mitochondrial membranes are common and serve various functions, their molecular architecture remains largely unknown. This study elucidates the interaction interface of the TAC60-p166 contact site. Using in silico, in vitro, and mutational in vivo analyses, we identified minimal binding segments between TAC60 and p166. The p166 binding site in TAC60 consists of a short kinked α-helix that interacts with the C-terminal α-helix of p166. Despite the presence of conserved charged residues in either protein, electrostatic interactions are not necessary for contact site formation. Instead, the TAC60-p166 interaction is driven by the hydrophobic effect, as converting conserved hydrophobic residues in either protein to hydrophilic amino acids disrupts the contact site.","Trypanosoma brucei brucei; Protozoan Proteins; Mitochondrial Membranes; Genome, Mitochondrial; Mitochondrial Proteins; Mitochondria; Binding Sites"
39621768,V. cholerae,666,,,"Vibrio cholerae RbmB is an α-1,4-polysaccharide lyase with biofilm-disrupting activity against Vibrio polysaccharide (VPS).","Many pathogenic bacteria form biofilms as a protective measure against environmental and host hazards. The underlying structure of the biofilm matrix consists of secreted macromolecules, often including exopolysaccharides. To escape the biofilm, bacteria may produce a number of matrix-degrading enzymes, including glycosidic enzymes that digest exopolysaccharide scaffolds. The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae assembles and secretes an exopolysaccharide called VPS (Vibrio polysaccharide) which is essential in most cases for the formation of biofilms and consists of a repeating tetrasaccharide unit. Previous studies have indicated that a secreted glycosidase called RbmB is involved in V. cholerae biofilm dispersal, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not understood. To approach the question of RbmB function, we recombinantly expressed and purified RbmB and tested its activity against purified VPS. Using a fluorescence-based biochemical assay, we show that RbmB specifically cleaves VPS in vitro under physiological conditions. Analysis of the cleavage process using mass spectrometry, solid-state NMR, and solution NMR indicates that RbmB cleaves VPS at a specific site (at the α-1,4 linkage between D-galactose and a modified L-gulose) into a mixture of tetramers and octamers. We demonstrate that the product of the cleavage contains a double bond in the modified guluronic acid ring, strongly suggesting that RbmB is cleaving using a glycoside lyase mechanism. Finally, we show that recombinant RbmB from V. cholerae and the related aquatic species Vibrio coralliilyticus are both able to disrupt living V. cholerae biofilms. Our results support the role of RbmB as a polysaccharide lyase involved in biofilm dispersal, as well as an additional glycolytic enzyme to add to the toolbox of potential therapeutic antibacterial enzymes.","Biofilms; Vibrio cholerae; Polysaccharide-Lyases; Polysaccharides, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; Cholera; Humans"
39621778,C. elegans,328850,,,Image-based force inference by biomechanical simulation.,"During morphogenesis, cells precisely generate forces that drive cell shape changes and cellular motion. These forces predominantly arise from contractility of the actomyosin cortex, allowing for cortical tension, protrusion formation, and cell division. Image-based force inference can derive such forces from microscopy images, without complicated and time-consuming experimental set-ups. However, current methods do not account for common effects, such as physical confinement and local force generation. Here we propose a force-inference method based on a biophysical model of cell shape, and assess relative cellular surface tension, adhesive tension between cells, as well as cytokinesis and protrusion formation. We applied our method on fluorescent microscopy images of the early C. elegans embryo. Predictions for cell surface tension at the 7-cell stage were validated by measurements using cortical laser ablation. Our non-invasive method facilitates the accurate tracking of force generation, and offers many new perspectives for studying morphogenesis.","Caenorhabditis elegans; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Models, Biological; Computer Simulation; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Cell Shape; Morphogenesis; Computational Biology; Cytokinesis; Embryo, Nonmammalian"

39622655,dogs,9615,,,Current status of intestinal parasite infections in fecal samples of dogs in Korea.,"This study surveyed the current status of intestinal parasite infections in Korean dog fecal samples. A total of 367 fecal samples were collected from the northern (Seoul and Gyeonggi-do), central (Chungcheong-do), and southern (Gyeongsang-do) regions and analyzed using the saturated sodium nitrate flotation technique and the nucleotide sequences of 18S rRNA. Six species of intestinal parasites were detected using the flotation technique. Among them, helminth eggs detected included Toxocara canis (6.0%), Toxascaris leonina (1.1%), Trichuris vulpis (6.8%), Ancylostoma caninum (2.7%), and Spirometra sp. (1.1%). Additionally, Cystoisospora sp. (7.6%) oocysts were also detected. The prevalence of intestinal parasite infections was higher in shelter dogs than in pet dogs. Molecular genetic assays revealed the gdh and 18S rRNA genes of Giardia duodenalis (type D) in 4.9% of fecal samples. To the best of our knowledge, 18S rRNA genes of Cryptosporidium canis were identified in 1.9% of fecal samples for the first time in Korea. These findings provide an overview of the current status of intestinal parasite infections in fecal samples of dogs from Korea and can be helpful in the surveillance of zoonotic parasite infections related to dogs.","Animals; Dogs; Feces; Dog Diseases; Republic of Korea; Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S; Prevalence; Trichuris"

In the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, sequence type (ST) associates with patient outcome. We performed a meta-analysis of four genomic studies and identified overlapping gene regions associated with virulence, suggesting the importance of these gene regions in cryptococcal disease in diverse clinical isolates. We explored the relationship between virulence and strain genetic differences using the cryptococcosis mouse model and a closely related library of ST93 clinical isolates. We identified four in vivo virulence phenotypes: hypervirulence, typical virulence with CNS disease, typical virulence with non-CNS disease, and latent disease. Hypervirulent isolates were clade specific and associated with an interferon gamma (IFNγ) dominated immune response. Using a genome wide association study (GWAS), we identified nine genes with polymorphisms associated with IFNγ production, including the inositol sensor ITR4. The itr4Δ mutant recapitulated the hypervirulence phenotype and ITR4 affects expression of two IFNγ associated genes. Finally, we showed that IFNγ production is associated with SNPs that downregulate ITR4 and with SNP accumulation in other IFNγ associated genes. These data highlight the complex role of pathogen genetics in virulence and identify genes associated with hypervirulence and IFNγ in Cryptococcus neoformans.","Animals; Humans; Mice; Cryptococcosis; Cryptococcus neoformans; Disease Models, Animal; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genome-Wide Association Study; Interferon-gamma; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Species Specificity; Virulence"
39622852,Petitella georgiae,2283134,,,Collective properties of Petitella georgiae in tube environments.,"The movement of biological swarms is widespread in nature, and collective behavior enhances a swarm's adaptability to its environment. However, most research focuses on free swarm movement, overlooking the impact of environmental constraints such as tubes. This study examines the swimming behavior of Petitella georgiae through a tube. Observations of position, speed, and direction reveal that each fish is influenced by the swarm's distribution in its field of view. The speed ratio between the middle region and edge region positively correlates with tube angles, and higher speeds are associated with higher densities within specific angle ranges.",
39622869,Bacillus subtilis,1423,bslA,51993415,Biofilm-based biocatalysis for β-cyclodextrin production by the surface-display of β-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase in Bacillus subtilis.,"β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is an important cyclic oligosaccharide, which is widely applicated in foods, environmental protection, and cosmetics, primarily prepared from enzymatic synthesis in traditional industry. However, several challenges persist, including cumbersome processes and difficulties in achieving continuous fermentation and catalysis. This research introduced a biofilm-based immobilized fermentation, integrating with enzyme catalysis system of surface display in Bacillus subtilis. The bslA gene was selected to construct the surface display system due to its ability to promote biofilm formation and serve as an anchorin. Compared to free cell catalysis, the biofilm-based immobilized catalysis expanded the temperature range to 40-70 and the pH range to 5-7.5. During the continuous catalysis process, by the 13th batch, the relative activity remained around 52%, and the conversion rate exceeded 36%, similar to the single-batch free cell catalysis. These findings provide valuable insights and effective strategies for the industrial production of β-CD and other biochemicals through continuous catalysis.","Bacillus subtilis; beta-Cyclodextrins; Biofilms; Biocatalysis; Glucosyltransferases; Fermentation; Temperature; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Bacterial Proteins; Enzymes, Immobilized"

39622925,Ilex asprella,185493,,,"Tissue-specific transcriptome analyses unveils candidate genes for flavonoid biosynthesis, regulation and transport in the medicinal plant Ilex asprella.","It is not clear that the genes involved with flavonoids synthesis, regulation and transport in Ilex asprella. Transcriptome analysis of leaf, stem and root has uncovered 28,478 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are involved in various biological processes. Among these, the expression of 31 candidate synthetase genes, 19 transcription factors, and 5 transporters associated with flavonoid biosynthesis varies across tissues, encompassing seven complete biosynthetic pathways (stilbene, aurone, flavone, isoflavone, flavonol, phlobaphene, and anthocyanin) and one partial pathway (proanthocyanidin). Tissue-specific expression patterns suggest that the stilbenes, aurones, flavones and anthocyanin branches are more prominent in roots, as indicated by key genes such as STS(Ilex_044726), CH4'GT(Ilex_047989), FNS(Ilex_043640) and UFGT(Ilex_014720). In leaves, the phlobaphenes and flavonols branches are dominant, determined by CHI(Ilex_005941), FNR(Ilex_039777) and FLS(Ilex_046424). The isoflavone pathway appears to be more active in stems due to the presence of IFS(Ilex_029360), mirroring the accumulation of the intermediate metabolite chalcone, which is regulated by CHS(Ilex_047537). The absence of LAR genes implies that gallocatechin, and catechin liked proanthocyanidins cannot be synthesized in I. asprella. Meanwhile, the general phenylpropanoid pathway is more active in roots, stems than in leaves, as evidenced by the expression of PAL(Ilex_042231, Ilex_014816), C4H(Ilex_017598), and 4CL(Ilex_042033). Flavanone, dihydroflavonol and leucoanthocyanidin, key intermediates, accumulate more rapidly in stem, stem and root, respectively, regulated by CHI(Ilex_005941), F3H(Ilex_004635) and DFR(Ilex_004771). Correlation and network analyses reveal that candidate regulators and transporters are closely associated with the synthesis genes. The study provides profound snoop into flavonoids metabolism in I. asprella and offers valuable refer for medicinal plant.","Flavonoids; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plants, Medicinal; Gene Expression Profiling; Ilex; Transcriptome; Biosynthetic Pathways; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plant Proteins; Biological Transport; Organ Specificity"
39622992,HIV,11676,TNF-A,7124,Cytokine profiles as predictors of HIV incidence using machine learning survival models and statistical interpretable techniques.,"HIV remains a critical global health issue, with an estimated 39.9 million people living with the virus worldwide by the end of 2023 (according to WHO). Although the epidemic's impact varies significantly across regions, Africa remains the most affected. In the past decade, considerable efforts have focused on developing preventive measures, such as vaccines and pre-exposure prophylaxis, to combat sexually transmitted HIV. Recently, cytokine profiles have gained attention as potential predictors of HIV incidence due to their involvement in immune regulation and inflammation, presenting new opportunities to enhance preventative strategies. However, the high-dimensional, time-varying nature of cytokine data collected in clinical research, presents challenges for traditional statistical methods like the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model to effectively analyze survival data related to HIV. Machine learning (ML) survival models offer a robust alternative, especially for addressing the limitations of the PH model's assumptions. In this study, we applied survival support vector machine (SSVM) and random survival forest (RSF) models using changes or means in cytokine levels as predictors to assess their association with HIV incidence, evaluate variable importance, measure predictive accuracy using the concordance index (C-index) and integrated Brier score (IBS) and interpret the model's predictions using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values. Our results indicated that RSFs models outperformed SSVMs models, with the difference covariate model performing better than the mean covariate model. The highest C-index for SSVM was 0.7180 under the difference covariate model, while for RSF, it reached 0.8801 under the difference covariate model using the log-rank split rule. Key cytokines identified as positive predictors of HIV incidence included TNF-A, BASIC-FGF, IL-5, MCP-3, and EOTAXIN, while 29 cytokines were negative predictors. Baseline factors such as condom use frequency, treatment status, number of partners, and sexual activity also emerged as significant predictors. This study underscored the potential of cytokine profiles for predicting HIV incidence and highlighted the advantages of RSFs models in analyzing high-dimensional, time-varying data over SSVMs. It further through ablation studies emphasized the importance of selecting key features within mean and difference based covariate models to achieve an optimal balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy.",Humans; HIV Infections; Cytokines; Machine Learning; Incidence; Male; Female; Adult; Proportional Hazards Models; Support Vector Machine

However, the coal exploration would cause ecological and environmental problems such as pollutions of water, soils and atmosphere. Especially, the pollution of heavy metals of soil has become increasingly severity. Plant enrichment and tolerance to heavy metals are crucial for the phytoremediation of coal gangue mountain. In phytoremediation, phytostabilization which can reduce the metal contamination of soil by uptake and burn-off of heavy metals with highly accumulating plants, is one of the most effective techniques of eco-remediation treatment. In present work, heavy metals contamination of soil and plants in the Yaojie mining which located in arid and semi-arid area of northwest China were investigated through field investigation. To identify the suitable plants for the remediation and ecological reclamation of heavy metal contaminated soil in typical mining area, the contamination characteristics of heavy metals in the above-ground parts of 27 native plants and their surrounding non-rhizosphere soils were analyzed. After eliminated by wet digestion and high-pressure closed digestion, the mass fractions of Zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) were determined with inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer, and the contents of Hydrargyrum (Hg) and Arsenic (As) were analyzed with atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer.

Natural fiber composites seek numerous applications nowadays due to its high strength is to weight ratio, high impact resistance, thermal stability, and recyclability. The literature study on natural fiber composites indicates lack of research on Kenaf fibers reinforced with E-glass fibers in conjunction with 0.5% and 1.0% of graphene. Hence, this research focuses on Kenaf fiber with percentage composition of graphene was varied as 0.5%, and 1.0%, by weight of the holding matrix and with/without incorporation of glass fiber. Suitable surface modifications were done by treating natural fibres by 0.5% NaOH for better adhesion of fibre and epoxy resin. Sonication and Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) treatments were also done to realize the fine scattering of graphene in the epoxy matrix in order to achieve better mechanical behaviour. Moulds were prepared as per D-638 ASTM standards. The treated fibres were then arranged in the mould by the conventional hand layup technique. The main objectives of this study are to conduct tensile, flexural, Impact, water absorption, machinability, and FTIR test. Result shows that the incorporation of graphene in natural fiber composites showed an increase in tensile strength, flexural strength, and water absorption properties by 27.7%, 53%, and 15% on average, respectively. The composites used in this research find their use in potential applications such as defence, biomedical aids, automobiles, packaging, actuators, etc. These often generate great interest, whenever there is a demand for fabricating lightweight and high strength material.",
39623375,Mycobacterium abscessus,36809,,,Cyclophostin and Cyclipostins analogues counteract macrolide-induced resistance mediated by erm(41) in Mycobacterium abscessus.,"Mycobacterium abscessus is an emerging pathogen causing severe pulmonary infections, particularly in individuals with underlying conditions, such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Macrolides, such as clarithromycin (CLR) or azithromycin (AZM), represent the cornerstone of antibiotherapy against the M. abscessus species. However, prolonged exposure to these macrolides can induce of Erm(41)-mediated resistance, limiting their spectrum of activity and leading to therapeutic failure. Therefore, inhibiting Erm(41) could thwart this resistance mechanism to maintain macrolide susceptibility, thus increasing the rate of treatment success. In our previous study, the Erm(41) methyltransferase was identified as a possible target enzyme of Cyclipostins and Cyclophostin compounds (CyC).","Mycobacterium abscessus; Macrolides; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Azithromycin; Clarithromycin; Humans; Bacterial Proteins; Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous; Methyltransferases; Microbial Sensitivity Tests"

39623721,TuYV,131083,,,The Turnip Yellows Virus Capsid Protein Promotes Access of Its Main Aphid Vector Myzus persicae to Phloem Tissues.,"Many plant viruses modify the phenotype of their hosts, which may influence the behaviour of their vectors and facilitate transmission. Among them is the turnip yellows virus (TuYV), which can modify the orientation, feeding, and performance of its main aphid vector, Myzus persicae. However, the virus factors driving these mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, we compared the feeding behaviour and fecundity of aphids on TuYV-infected and transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing individual TuYV proteins (CP, RT and P0) to define the role of these proteins in aphid-plant interactions. Aphids on TuYV-infected plants had shorter pathway phases and ingested phloem sap for longer times, which is expected to promote the acquisition of the phloem-limited TuYV. No change in aphid fecundity was observed on TuYV-infected plants. The transmission-conducive feeding behaviour changes could be fully reproduced by phloem-specific expression of the capsid protein (CP) in transgenic plants, whereas expression of P0 had minor and RT had no effects on aphid feeding behaviour. We then carried out a metabolomic analysis to determine plant compounds that could be involved in the modification of the aphid behaviour. A few metabolites were specific for TuYV-infected or CP-transgenic A. thaliana, and are good candidates for inducing behavioural changes.","Aphids; Animals; Phloem; Arabidopsis; Capsid Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Insect Vectors; Luteoviridae; Plant Diseases; Feeding Behavior; Fertility"

However, pests can affect yields even when controls work as expected. Further, most pest populations are monitored through adult counts without procedures to assess dynamics of immature stages. Here, we propose a framework to assess the efficacy of control treatments from adult counts in non-experimental setups based on the shifts in temporal patterns of adult emergence caused during the residual period of treatments applied to kill immatures. We use phenology models scaled to field counts to track the stage structure of pest populations across a season and produce reference population trajectories with and without the treatment. Field-collected trajectories are then classified as with or without an effective control through a time-sequential probability ratio test. The method was evaluated using pheromone trap captures of codling moth, Cydia pomonella, and four of the most widely implemented treatment programs in apple and pear orchards.",Animals; Moths; Insect Control; Insecticides; Pyrus; Malus; Pest Control

39625532,bees,7460,,,Vector-based navigation in desert ants: the significance of path-integration vectors.,"In the longstanding discussion of whether insects, especially central place foragers such as bees and ants, use metric representations of their landmark surroundings (so-called ""cognitive maps""), the ability to find novel shortcuts between familiar locations has been considered one of the most decisive proofs for the use of such maps. Here we show by channel-based field experiments that desert ants Cataglyphis can travel such shortcuts between locations (defined by memorized goal vectors) just on the basis of path integration. When trained to visit two spatially separated feeders A and B they later travel the hitherto novel route A→B. This behavior may originate from the interaction of goal vectors retrieved from long-term memory and the current vector computed by the continuously running path integrator. Based on former experiments, we further argue that path integration is a necessary requirement also for acquiring landmark information (in form of learned goal-directed views). This emphasizes the paramount importance of path integration in these central place foragers. Finally we hypothesize that the ant's overall system of navigation consists in the optimal combination of path-integration vectors and view-based vectors, and thus handles and uses vectorial information without the need of constructing a ""vector map"", in which vectors are linked to known places in the environment others than to the origin of all journeys, the nest.",Animals; Ants; Spatial Navigation; Desert Climate; Space Perception; Homing Behavior

However, the usefulness of these assays in assessing responses to anthelmintic treatment is unclear. Thus, we evaluated the diagnostic performance and temporal profiles of Strongyloides-specific IgG antibodies in a cohort of participants at baseline and post-treatment. The participants were prospectively screened for baseline parasitic infections by fecal examination [agar plate culture technique (APCT) and formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT)] and digital droplet polymerase reaction (ddPCR) for Strongyloides stercoralis. At each sampling point, Strongyloides-specific IgG in urine and serum were measured by an in-house S. ratti-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At baseline, 169 of 351 participants (48.1%) had S. stercoralis infection by the combined fecal examination and ddPCR. The diagnostic sensitivities of IgG in urine and serum were 91.1% and 88.2%, respectively. The participants were given treatment with a single oral dose of ivermectin (IVM, 200 μg/kg) and were followed up by fecal and immunological diagnosis at 3 to 18 months post-treatment. The cure rate of IVM treatment evaluated by APCT and ddPCR was 88.3% at three months post-treatment. The profiles of IgG in urine in the curative treatment group showed a significant trend of decline with time post-treatment (Kruskal-Wallis test = 113.4-212.6, p value < 0.0001) and the lowest levels were seen 12 months post-treatment. The treatment response (> 50% reduction in urinary IgG antibody units) was 100%, and conversion from positive to negative results was 65.4%.

39625994,C. magnificus,156157,,,"Hyperspectral imaging in animal coloration research: A user-friendly pipeline for image generation, analysis, and integration with 3D modeling.","Hyperspectral imaging-a technique that combines the high spectral resolution of spectrophotometry with the high spatial resolution of photography-holds great promise for the study of animal coloration. However, applications of hyperspectral imaging to questions about the ecology and evolution of animal color remain relatively rare. The approach can be expensive and unwieldy, and we lack user-friendly pipelines for capturing and analyzing hyperspectral data in the context of animal color. Fortunately, costs are decreasing and hyperspectral imagers are improving, particularly in their sensitivity to wavelengths (including ultraviolet) visible to diverse animal species. To highlight the potential of hyperspectral imaging for animal coloration studies, we developed a pipeline for capturing, sampling, and analyzing hyperspectral data (here, in the 325 nm to 700 nm range) using avian museum specimens. Specifically, we used the pipeline to characterize the plumage colors of the King bird-of-paradise (Cicinnurus regius), Magnificent bird-of-paradise (C. magnificus), and their putative hybrid, the King of Holland's bird-of-paradise (C. magnificus x C. regius). We also combined hyperspectral data with 3D digital models to supplement hyperspectral images of each specimen with 3D shape information. Using visual system-independent methods, we found that many plumage patches on the hybrid King of Holland's bird-of-paradise are-to varying degrees-intermediate relative to those of the parent species. This was true of both pigmentary and structurally colored plumage patches. Using visual system-dependent methods, we showed that only some of the differences in plumage patches among the hybrid and its parent species would be perceivable by birds. Hyperspectral imaging is poised to become the gold standard for many animal coloration applications: comprehensive reflectance data-across the entire surface of an animal specimen-can be obtained in a matter of minutes. Our pipeline provides a practical and flexible roadmap for incorporating hyperspectral imaging into future studies of animal color.","Animals; Hyperspectral Imaging; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Pigmentation; Feathers; Color; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Passeriformes; Birds"

A simple model with three genotype-specific parameters explained the differences in flowering response to daylength. Environmental factors causing flower abortion, such as low temperature and radiation and high humidity, led to a longer flowering-to-podding interval. Late podding associated with poor partition to grain, limiting yield in favourable environments. The genotype Sonali, carrying the early allele of Caelf3a (elf3a), was generally the earliest to set pod and had low biomass but the highest harvest index.

As the surface of the bacteria is covered with versatile polysaccharides and proteins, these influence the interactions of the bacterium with any surface. The unique properties and high stability of fungal proteins make them good candidates for the control of bacteria by targeting surface structures. We screened a group of fungal lectins and protease inhibitors from different fungal species, protein folds and known targets for their antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against model strains of Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. Several of them significantly decreased the viability of biofilm bacteria, but had no effect on bacterial growth parameters at 37°C and thus had no antibacterial activity.

Vaccination offers the best protection against this disease, and two rotavirus vaccines were developed in India and included in its routine immunization program. The Government of India's decision to adopt this intervention was supported by a solid base of evidence from clinical trials, as well as substantial research regarding rotavirus disease burden and the potential health and economic value of immunization. Following program implementation, multiple studies were initiated, including three evaluations of effectiveness and several investigations regarding intussusception. These additional data regarding vaccine impact, safety, and delivery from post-introduction evaluations in conditions of real-world use will further strengthen and sustain the immunization program. This manuscript evaluates the status of existing and forthcoming evidence regarding rotavirus vaccination in India through a literature review and consultation with relevant stakeholders. Studies evaluating vaccine impact, effectiveness, safety, health economics, and acceptability, as well as operational and programmatic research, were included in the review. Overall, we found that the evidence base did not contain any major gaps. Nevertheless, additional smaller-scale research studies would be valuable in providing a more complete picture of rotavirus vaccine performance and benefit. Documentation of India's experience with rotavirus vaccines may provide lessons learned for other countries in the Asia region, where rotavirus disease burden remains high, yet vaccine adoption has been slow, as well as for countries worldwide that may be considering implementation of the Indian-made rotavirus vaccines.",Humans; Rotavirus Vaccines; Rotavirus Infections; India; Immunization Programs; Vaccination; Rotavirus; Diarrhea; Infant; Vaccine Efficacy
39616196,Metacarcinus edwardsii,598739,,,The timing of marine heatwaves during the moulting cycle affects performance of decapod larvae.,"Marine heatwaves (MHW) pose an increasing threat and have a critical impact on meroplanktonic organisms, because their larvae are highly sensitive to environmental stress and key for species' dispersion and population connectivity. This study assesses the effects of MHW on two key moulting cycle periods within first zoea of the valuable crab, Metacarcinus edwardsii. First, the changes in swimming behaviour during zoea I were recorded and associated to moult cycle substages. Then, larvae were exposed during the zoea I to (1) control temperature of 12 °C, (2) Early MHW, occurring in intermoult, (3) Late MHW, occurring in premoult and (4) 14 °C, representing MHW during whole development. Additionally, optimum temperature was estimated from thermal performance curves through swimming behaviour of one-day zoea I. The timing of the MHW within the moulting cycle significantly affects larval fitness. Early MHW led to improved survival rates (72%) and reduced developmental times (9.8 days) compared to those exposed to Later MHW (63% and 10.3 days, respectively). As optimum temperature was higher than 12 °C, MHW events maybe favouring larval performance. These results highlight the importance of interaction between the moult cycle and environmental variables as a factor of sublethal effects on population dynamics.",Animals; Larva; Molting; Swimming; Brachyura; Hot Temperature
39616201,apple,3750,,,The trade-off between soil water recovery and nitrate leaching following the orchard-to-cropland conversion in the Chinese Loess Plateau.,"A large-scale conversion of apple orchards into farmland has occurred in the tableland region of the Chinese Loess Plateau due to the aging of apple trees and the increase in pests and diseases. However, the impact of this conversion on soil desiccation recovery and soil nutrient transportation remains unclear, posing a new challenge for sustainable agricultural development in the region. The study employed the space-time substitution approach to select a long-standing orchard and croplands that has been growing maize for 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-years post-orchard conversion as sampling sites, to investigate the effects of recovery durations of orchard-to-cropland conversion on deep soil water recharge and residual nitrate dynamics, as well as the key factors driving these changes. The results indicated that within 5 years, the conversion led to a rapid recharge of desiccated deep soil (6-9 m), followed by a stable and slow increase in subsequent years. The annual soil water recovery rate in the deep soil was as high as 5.90 mm m",

Here, we explore the association between gut microbiota and depression by utilizing 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and depression assessment scales, including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The study cohort consisted of 46 subjects, who were categorized into depression and normal groups based on medical diagnoses and depression scale scores. Our analyses revealed that HDRS-based classification better identified distinct gut microbiota structures associated with depression than medical diagnoses alone. Notably, lower beta diversity was observed in individuals with depression, indicating a more homogeneous gut microbial community.

However, the function of Brassica juncea (L.) Czern & Coss GRFs remain largely unknown. In this study, 34 BjGRF genes were identified in B. juncea. BjGRF members of the same subfamily were found to share a similar motif composition and gene structure. In total, 663 cis-acting elements were found in the promoter regions of BjGRF genes, which were related to light response, hormone response, environmental stresses, and plant growth/development. Additionally, 48 pairs of segmental duplication genes were identified during gene duplication events, and no tandemly duplicated genes were identified. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the 34 BjGRF genes were primarily expressed in the roots, followed by the leaves. Furthermore, the 10 BjGRF genes were screened in response to drought stress, and the expression patterns of the genes were relatively consistent, with a maximum expression level at 3 or 24 h, and the selected BjGRF03 and BjGRF32 might be involved in drought stress. This preliminary study clarifies the response of the BjGRF gene family to drought stress and provides ideas for further analyses of the biological functions of BjGRF genes.","Mustard Plant; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Droughts; Plant Proteins; Stress, Physiological; Transcription Factors; Genome, Plant; Phylogeny; Gene Duplication; Gene Expression Profiling; Promoter Regions, Genetic"

39617946,S. suis,1307,,,Biofilm formation in Streptococcus suis: in vitro impact of serovars and assessment of coinfections with other porcine respiratory disease complex bacterial pathogens.,"Streptococcus suis is a worldwide pathogen that impacts the swine industry, causing severe clinical signs, including meningitis and arthritis, in postweaning piglets. A key virulence mechanism of S. suis is biofilm formation, which improves its persistence and resistance to external factors. Here, we assessed the in vitro biofilm formation of 240 S. suis isolates from Spanish swine farms and evaluated the effects of serovars (SVs) and coinfections with other porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) pathogens. Our study revealed significant heterogeneity in biofilm formation among S. suis SVs. Notably, SV2 resulted in the lowest degree of biofilm formation, in contrast with the high biofilm-forming capacities of SV1, SV7, and SV9. Other PRDC pathogens, including Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Glaesserella parasuis, and Pasteurella multocida, formed biofilms, although they were generally less robust than those of S. suis (except for SV2), which contrasts with the high biofilm formation of Staphylococcus hyicus. Coinfections enhanced biofilm formation in mixed cultures of S. suis, particularly with P. multocida. Other coinfections revealed variable results in pathogen interactions, suggesting the potential of biofilms for increased persistence and pathogenicity in coinfections. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of serovar-specific differences in biofilm formation among S. suis isolates, with significant implications for pathogenicity and persistence. The heterogeneous biofilm formation observed in coinfections with other PRDC pathogens reveals a complex interplay that could exacerbate disease severity. These findings provide a foundation for further research on biofilm mechanisms to mitigate the impact of PRDC in the swine industry.",Animals; Streptococcus suis; Biofilms; Swine Diseases; Swine; Coinfection; Streptococcal Infections; Serogroup; Spain

39617959,Streptomyces,1930,,,Lrp Family Regulator SCAB_Lrp2 Responds to the Precursor Tryptophan and Represses the Thaxtomin Biosynthesis in Streptomyces scabies.,"Streptomyces scabies is a well-researched plant pathogen belonging to the genus Streptomyces. Its virulence is linked to the production of the secondary metabolite thaxtomin A, which is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. The leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) family is conserved in prokaryotes and is involved in various crucial biological processes. However, the regulatory interaction between Lrp protein and pathogenic Streptomyces species remains poorly understood. This study aims to explore the role of SCAB_Lrp2 in regulating thaxtomin biosynthesis and pathogenicity, and to analyse the shared and unique features of Lrp homologues in S. scabies. We observed that SCAB_Lrp2 (SCAB_75421) showed significant homology with SCAB_Lrp, a recognised activator of thaxtomin A production in S. scabies. Our results revealed a regulatory interaction between SCAB_Lrp2 and SCAB_Lrp in terms of their targets, although SCAB_Lrp2 does not respond to the amino acid-effectors of SCAB_Lrp. In contrast to SCAB_Lrp, deletion of SCAB_Lrp2 resulted in a notable increase in thaxtomin A production with the emergence of a hypervirulent phenotype in S. scabies. Further analysis revealed that SCAB_Lrp2 represses the transcription of the thaxtomin biosynthetic gene cluster by directly regulating the cluster-situated regulator (CSR) gene txtR. Moreover, the precursor of thaxtomin, tryptophan, acts as an effector of SCAB_Lrp2, strengthening the repressive effect on thaxtomin biosynthesis through txtR. These findings provide new insights into the functional conservation and diversity of Lrp homologues involved in the biosynthesis of thaxtomin phytotoxins in pathogenic Streptomyces species.","Streptomyces; Bacterial Proteins; Tryptophan; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Leucine-Responsive Regulatory Protein; Indoles; Virulence; Piperazines"
39618122,Serratia sp.,616,,,Crystal structure of a novel heterooligomeric aminotransferase from Serratia sp. ATCC 39006 provides insights into function.,"Serratia sp.

Ser5 possesses a complete fold-type I aminotransferase fold, while Ser4 lacks the N- and C-terminal regions and a catalytically important lysine residue of fold-type I aminotransferase. We herein revealed that Ser4 and Ser5 formed a heterotetrameric complex (SerTA) with aminotransferase activity and determined the crystal structures. MD simulations and activity assays with SerTA variants indicated that residues from helix α-8* of inactive Ser4 are important for activity, confirming the importance of heterocomplex formation for activity. Furthermore, the structures suggest that SerTA recognizes a substrate loaded on the carrier protein.","Serratia; Transaminases; Crystallography, X-Ray; Bacterial Proteins; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Protein Multimerization; Amino Acid Sequence; Substrate Specificity"

This case presentation discusses a neonate who had a fever at four days of life who then underwent a full sepsis evaluation. A respiratory viral panel demonstrated rhino/enterovirus positivity. A lumbar puncture was consistent with aseptic meningitis and newborn was prophylactically covered with acyclovir until the cerebrospinal fluid PCR confirmed enterovirus positivity and was negative for herpes simplex virus. The neonate experienced thrombocytosis and elevated transaminase levels, which resolved before discharge. Acyclovir was discontinued following a pediatric infectious disease consultation. The patient steadily improved, passed all screenings, and was discharged on day 16 with follow-up appointments arranged, including developmental pediatrics and repeat hearing screenings. Despite the viral panel indicating a respiratory virus, the presence of a respiratory virus in a neonate does not necessarily reduce the risk of a serious bacterial illness, especially in infants younger than 29 days. Viral meningitis can be associated with substantial complications and, so viral PCR testing of the cerebrospinal fluid allows clinicians to monitor for the development of severe disease and set up outpatient follow-ups for potential long-term sequelae of viral meningitis, such as neurodevelopmental delays.",

Histopathological examination remains the gold standard for a definitive and accurate diagnosis. This process relies on an initial step of tissue fixation. Formaldehyde is a traditional fixative material and is typically used as 10% or 4% buffered solutions. However, significant health risks are associated with formaldehyde exposure. Our paper aimed to evaluate and compare variable media as a preservative agent. The study included eight groups as follows: (1) normal saline 0.9%; (2) local anesthesia with epinephrine (2% Lidocaine HCl/ 1:100,000 epi); (3) local anesthesia without epinephrine (3% Mepivacaine HCl/ plain); (4) distilled water; (5) Saliva collected from healthy male participants; (6) Milk (Almarai- full-fat fresh milk); (7) Propolis; and (8) l0% formalin. Three tissue samples from each group were fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h after being preserved for 6 h at ambient temperature in their respective media. All specimens were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin.

Many individuals in these predator populations have been found to display trap-shyness, which hinders eradication and results in inaccurate estimates of population size. Lures are used to help overcome trap-shyness by increasing the probability of interaction with the device, but the extent of trap-shyness in wild populations, and the best timing for the introduction of a new lure or combination of lures, are uncertain. A key challenge for wildlife managers is maximising the efficacy of invasive predator control, particularly in relation to baiting and trapping, so that pests are extirpated, or survivors are reduced to a minimum.

Frozen desserts containing brown rice, pea, and soy protein showed greater resistance to melting (0.29, 0.12, and 0.19%/min vs. 1.95%/min), but they scored lower in sensory quality than ice cream made with milk protein; although they remained at an acceptable level. When compared among the plant proteins, the physicochemical characteristics of frozen desserts containing brown rice, pea, and soy protein varied because of the differences in the respective protein composition. Frozen dessert with brown rice protein showed higher overrun (47.50% vs. 40.78% and 37.8%), lower hardness (20.02 N vs. 22.24 and 26.37 N), and higher melting rate (0.29%/min vs. 0.19 and 0.12%/min) than frozen desserts containing soy and pea protein. Additionally, the brown rice protein frozen dessert received lower sensory acceptance than soy and pea protein frozen desserts. In summary, brown rice, pea, and soy proteins showed potential to be used as viable alternatives to milk protein for dairy-free frozen dessert applications.",

Animal seed dispersers might be particularly important in assisting plants tracking suitable climates to higher elevations. However, this role is still poorly understood due to a lack of comprehensive multi-guild datasets along elevational gradients. We compiled seed dispersal networks for the five altitudinal vegetation belts of the Tenerife Island (0-3718 m above sea level) to explore how plant and animal species might facilitate the mutual colonisation of uphill habitats under climate change. The overall network comprised 283 distinct interactions between 73 plant and 27 animal species, with seed dispersers offering viable pathways for plants to colonise upper vegetation belts. A pivotal role is played by a lizard as island-level hub, while four birds and one introduced mammal (rabbit) are also important connectors between belts. Eleven plant species were empirically found to be actively dispersed to elevations beyond their current known range, with observed vertical dispersal distances largely surpassing those required to escape climate change. Furthermore, over half of the plants arriving at higher elevations were exotic. Functionally diverse disperser communities are crucial for enabling plants tracking climate change on mountains, but exotic plants might particularly benefit from this upward lift.",Climate Change; Altitude; Animals; Seed Dispersal; Plants; Forests; Biodiversity; Birds
39621726,Aquilaria Lam,69461,,,Resinous included phloem as a key indicator of authentic or fake agarwood.,"Agarwood, the resinous wood of the genus Aquilaria Lam. and Gyrinops Gaertn. of the family Thymelaeaceae, is a very valuable traditional medicinal material and spice. Due to the high economic value of agarwood, unscrupulous merchants have led to the prevalence of fake agarwood in the trade market in pursuit of high profits. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the characteristics of agarwood and establish a simple and rapid method to identify authenticity. This study compared the authenticity of the microstructure of agarwood from different producing areas with that of artificially simulated fake agarwood. The included phloem of authentic agarwood contains brown to brownish resin. And these resins were naturally and stably distributed. The fake agarwood is divided into two categories: one itself is non-agarwood wood (without included phloem), and the other is artificially counterfeiting. However, the filling of resin in the included phloem of agarwood did not occur after artificially simulated counterfeiting treatments. Of the 18 commercially available samples, 10 had the same microstructure as agarwood, but six of them were not completely filled with resin in the included phloem. Therefore, the resinous included phloem is a key characteristic structure of agarwood. It can be used as a basis for authenticity identification of agarwood. This will provide a convenient and rapid method for promoting and popularizing agarwood authentication in trade, customs enforcement, CITES management, and other fields.","Phloem; Wood; Thymelaeaceae; Resins, Plant"

39621770,Chickpea,3827,,,Chickpea NCR13 disulfide cross-linking variants exhibit profound differences in antifungal activity and modes of action.,"Small cysteine-rich antifungal peptides with multi-site modes of action (MoA) have potential for development as biofungicides. In particular, legumes of the inverted repeat-lacking clade express a large family of nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides that orchestrate differentiation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria into bacteroids. These NCRs can form two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds and a subset of these peptides with high cationicity exhibits antifungal activity. However, the importance of intramolecular disulfide pairing and MoA against fungal pathogens for most of these plant peptides remains to be elucidated. Our study focused on a highly cationic chickpea NCR13, which has a net charge of +8 and contains six cysteines capable of forming three disulfide bonds. NCR13 expression in Pichia pastoris resulted in formation of two peptide folding variants, NCR13_PFV1 and NCR13_PFV2, that differed in the pairing of two out of three disulfide bonds despite having an identical amino acid sequence. The NMR structure of each PFV revealed a unique three-dimensional fold with the PFV1 structure being more compact but less dynamic. Surprisingly, PFV1 and PFV2 differed profoundly in the potency of antifungal activity against several fungal plant pathogens and their multi-faceted MoA. PFV1 showed significantly faster fungal cell-permeabilizing and cell entry capabilities as well as greater stability once inside the fungal cells. Additionally, PFV1 was more effective in binding fungal ribosomal RNA and inhibiting protein translation in vitro. Furthermore, when sprayed on pepper and tomato plants, PFV1 was more effective in reducing disease symptoms caused by Botrytis cinerea, causal agent of gray mold disease in fruits, vegetables, and flowers. In conclusion, our work highlights the significant impact of disulfide pairing on the antifungal activity and MoA of NCR13 and provides a structural framework for design of novel, potent antifungal peptides for agricultural use.",Antifungal Agents; Disulfides; Plant Proteins; Cicer; Plant Diseases; Fusarium; Botrytis; Amino Acid Sequence; Peptides
39621775,Alle alle,28691,,,Long distance calls: Negligible information loss of little auk social vocalisations due to high frequency propagation losses.,"How well does the information contained in vocal signals travel through the environment? To assess the efficiency of information transfer in little auk (Alle alle, an Arctic seabird) calls over distance, we selected two of the social call types with the highest potential for individuality coding. Using available recordings of known individuals, we calculated the apparent source levels, with apparent maximum peak sound pressure level (ASPL) of 63 dB re 20 μPa at 1 m for both call types. Further, we created a sound attenuation model using meteorological data collected in the vicinity of the little auk colony in Hornsund, Spitsbergen. Using this model, we modelled the calls to reflect higher frequency filtering and sound level loss occurring during spherical spreading in perfect local conditions, down to the putative hearing threshold of the species, calculated to equal ASPL of signals ""propagated"" to roughly one kilometre. Those modelled calls were then used in a permuted discriminant function analysis, support vector machine models, and linear models of Beecher's information statistic, to investigate whether transmission loss will affect the retention of individual information of the signal. Calls could be correctly classified to individuals above chance level independently of the distance, down to and over the putative physiological hearing threshold. Interestingly, the information capacity of the signal did not decrease with its filtering and attenuation. While this study touches on signal properties purely and cannot provide evidence of the actual use by the animals, it shows that little auk signals can theoretically travel long distances with negligible information loss, and supports the hypothesis that vocalisations could facilitate long-distance communication in the species.","Animals; Vocalization, Animal; Sound Spectrography; Computational Biology; Acoustics; Social Behavior"
39621811,Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25,216595,,,A chromosomal mutation is superior to a plasmid-encoded mutation for plasmid fitness cost compensation.,"Plasmids are important vectors of horizontal gene transfer in microbial communities but can impose a burden on the bacteria that carry them. Such plasmid fitness costs are thought to arise principally from conflicts between chromosomal- and plasmid-encoded molecular machineries, and thus can be ameliorated by compensatory mutations (CMs) that reduce or resolve the underlying causes. CMs can arise on plasmids (i.e., plaCM) or on chromosomes (i.e., chrCM), with contrasting predicted effects upon plasmid success and subsequent gene transfer because plaCM can also reduce fitness costs in plasmid recipients, whereas chrCM can potentially ameliorate multiple distinct plasmids. Here, we develop theory and a novel experimental system to directly compare the ecological effects of plaCM and chrCM that arose during evolution experiments between Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its sympatric mercury resistance megaplasmid pQBR57. We show that while plaCM was predicted to succeed under a broader range of parameters in mathematical models, chrCM dominated in our experiments, including conditions with numerous recipients, due to a more efficacious mechanism of compensation, and advantages arising from transmission of costly plasmids to competitors (plasmid ""weaponisation""). We show analytically the presence of a mixed Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) regime for CMs, driven by trade-offs with horizontal transmission, that offers one possible explanation for the observed failure of plaCM to dominate even in competition against an uncompensated plasmid. Our results reveal broader implications of plasmid-bacterial evolution for plasmid ecology, demonstrating the importance of specific compensatory mutations for resistance gene spread. One consequence of the superiority of chrCM over plaCM is the likely emergence in microbial communities of compensated bacteria that can act as ""hubs"" for plasmid accumulation and dissemination.","Plasmids; Pseudomonas fluorescens; Mutation; Chromosomes, Bacterial; Genetic Fitness; Gene Transfer, Horizontal; Evolution, Molecular"

We found that pH and drip loss increased gradually during storage and WRMD2 exhibited a significantly lower pH and higher drip loss than CB. In both groups, aerobic plate counts, volatile basic nitrogen, and lipid oxidation levels increased, whereas creatine and dipeptide levels gradually decreased during storage. WRMD2 exhibited a significantly higher anserine content and lower carnosine-to-anserine ratio than CB. Flavor nucleotide content was influenced more by the storage period, whereas fatty acid composition was affected more by genetic differences. WRMD2 exhibited significantly higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially C20:4n6 and C22:6n3, than CB. Interestingly, multivariate analysis highlighted several volatile compounds, including methyl salicylate (day 1), dodecanal (day 3), naphthalene (day 5), and 2,4-decadienal (day 7) as potential biomarkers to distinguish between WRMD2 and CB on each storage day. Correlation analysis identified five key meat quality traits, including drip loss, aerobic plate counts, and anserine that are strongly associated with flavor substances, such as inosine monophosphate, guanosine monophosphate, 1-octen-3-ol, and hexanal.

This study aims to examine the expression stability of nine candidate RGs for the Avena sativa - Blumeria graminis experimental setup. B. graminis causes powdery mildew - the most devastating and economically important fungal disease of crops worldwide. RGs were evaluated in Pm3 and Pm4 oat differential lines and the susceptible cultivar Fuchs during compatible and incompatible interactions with different pathotypes of Blumeria graminis f. sp. avenae in six-time points post inoculation. The identification of genes exhibiting high expression stability was done by four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and deltaCt). The results indicated that regardless of the analysed group, two most stable RGs are required for data normalization. The most sufficient RGs combination was HNR (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein 27 C) + EIF4A (eukaryotic initiation factor 4 A‑3). ARF (ADP‑ribosylation factor) could also be pondered as demonstrating high expression stability. These genes can be considered universal candidates for RT-qPCR normalization to study interaction with B. graminis as well as Puccinia coronata and Puccinia graminis, as confirmed by our previous research. The worst candidate for data standardisation was TUA (α- tubulin). To our best knowledge, this is the first report regarding RGs' selection in this pathosystem. Identified RGs are proper normalisation candidates for gene expression studies in the A. sativa infected by B. graminis as well as other related pathogens.","Ascomycota; Avena; Plant Diseases; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Expression Profiling; Stress, Physiological; Reference Standards; Genes, Plant; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Plant Proteins"

Several questions remain about their persistence, in vivo formation, composition, and function. Our study reveals that HIV-1-MLOs persisted for several weeks in infected cells, and their abundance correlated with viral infectivity. Using an appropriate animal model, we show that HIV-1-MLOs were formed in vivo during acute infection. To explore the viral structures present within these biomolecular condensates, we used a combination of double immunogold labeling, electron microscopy and tomography, and unveiled a diverse array of viral core structures. Our functional analyses showed that HIV-1-MLOs remained stable during treatment with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, maintaining the virus in a dormant state. Drug withdrawal restored reverse transcription, promoting efficient virus replication akin to that observed in latently infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. However, when HIV-1 MLOs were deliberately disassembled by pharmacological treatment, we observed a complete loss of viral infectivity.

This framework alleviates much of the computational burden associated with traditional spatiotemporal individual-level models for epidemics, and facilitates the use of standard software for fitting logistic models when analysing spatiotemporal disease patterns. The models can be fitted in either a frequentist or Bayesian framework. Here, we apply the new spatial CL-ILM to simulated data, semi-real data from the UK 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic, and real data from a greenhouse experiment on the spread of tomato spotted wilt virus.",

One of the tests requested is for biomarkers, which are important as they can provide data on intestinal functionality, intensity of inflammation, and response to treatment, and can help determine the prognosis. This study aimed to conduct a literature review on the main serum and fecal intestinal biomarkers in dogs and proposed to refine the correlations between these indicators and enteropathies. It was observed that the main biomarkers used in the intestinal evaluation of dogs were alpha 1-proteinase inhibitory factor, immunoglobulin A, methylmalonic acid, serum folate, serum cobalamin, C-reactive protein, fecal and serum calprotectin, and dysbiosis index. However, we suggest that more research be carried out to clarify the relationship between enteropathies and intestinal biomarkers. We noticed a lack of studies on specific intestinal markers and indicator variables in healthy dogs and those with various enteropathies; moreover, no data are available on the association of these laboratory parameters.",

OC43 is a ubiquitous pathogen that now causes a common cold, but its emergence in 1890 closely coincided with and likely produced the catastrophic Russian Flu pandemic. Beyond their historical parallels, OC43 and CoV-2 share similar genetics and disease sequelae. Both viruses induce respiratory symptoms. Additionally, OC43 infection can result in acute neurological dysfunction in children, and exposure to OC43 has been linked to long-term neurological disorders in adults. Similarly, CoV-2 can produce acute neuropathology and the phenomenon of prolonged symptoms known as Long-COVID that typically impacts the brain. Mouse models have been developed to study the pathogenesis of both OC43 and CoV-2, thereby facilitating research on the neurological sequelae associated with either infection. These models have been further utilized to test therapeutic interventions against both viruses, as researchers seek to establish the potential for using OC43 as a proxy for CoV-2. Further, because mouse models of the two betacoronaviruses exhibit neurological sequelae, using OC43 likely could provide insight into the impact of COVID-19 on the brain. OC43 requires a lower biosafety level than CoV-2, which makes it accessible to more researchers resulting in expeditious scientific progress in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",

39625738,Pst,12354,,,The E3 ubiquitin ligase TaGW2 facilitates TaSnRK1γ and TaVPS24 degradation to enhance stripe rust susceptibility in wheat.,"Wheat stripe rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), threatens global wheat production, and therefore discovering genes involved in stripe rust susceptibility is essential for balancing yield with disease resistance in sustainable breeding strategies. Although TaGW2 is well known to negatively regulate wheat kernel size and weight, its role in stress response remains unclear. Here, we found that TaGW2 transcription levels increased following inoculation with Pst or treatment with flg22 or chitin. TaGW2 knockdown lines showed enhanced resistance to multiple Pst races, while TaGW2 overexpression reduced host defence response, promoted Pst growth and development and increased wheat susceptibility to Pst. Additionally, TaGW2 could mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of both TaSnRK1γ and TaVPS24 via the 26S proteasome pathway. Silencing TaSnRK1γ or TaVPS24 in wheat increased sensitivity to Pst, whereas overexpressing either gene enhanced wheat defence response, indicating that TaSnRK1γ and TaVPS24 act as positive regulators of Pst resistance. This study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism inhibiting plant immunity to Pst through TaGW2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of TaSnRK1γ and TaVPS24. This work also provides crucial genetic resources for breeding high-yield, stripe rust-resistant wheat varieties.","Triticum; Plant Diseases; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Plant Proteins; Disease Resistance; Basidiomycota; Puccinia; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Ubiquitination"

A promising venue to engage high-risk populations in PrEP care is the emergency department (ED); however, existing ED PrEP initiatives have been costly or have had limited success. We hypothesize that two strategies could overcome these barriers: prescribing PrEP during an ED visit and providing patients with an initial supply of PrEP medication in the ED.

39625861,carrot,4039,Pparg,19016,"Effect of carrot intake on glucose tolerance, microbiota, and gene expression in a type 2 diabetes mouse model.","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathophysiology involves insulin resistance (IR) and inadequate insulin secretion. Current T2D management includes dietary adjustments and/or oral medications such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Carrots have shown to contain bioactive acetylenic oxylipins that are partial agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparg) that mimic the antidiabetic effect of TZDs without any adverse effects. TZDs exert hypoglycemic effects through activation of Pparg and through the regulation of the gut microbiota (GM) producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which impact glucose and energy homeostasis, promote intestinal gluconeogenesis, and influence insulin signaling pathways. This study investigated the metabolic effects of carrot intake in a T2D mouse model, elucidating underlying mechanisms. Mice were fed a low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD), or adjusted HFD supplemented with 10% carrot powder for 16 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at weeks 0 and 16. Fecal, cecum, and colon samples, as well as tissue samples, were collected at week 16 during the autopsy. Results showed improved oral glucose tolerance in the HFD carrot group compared to HFD alone after 16 weeks. GM analysis demonstrated increased diversity and compositional changes in the cecum of mice fed HFD with carrot relative to HFD. These findings suggest the potential effect of carrots in T2D management, possibly through modulation of GM. Gene expression analysis revealed no significant alterations in adipose or muscle tissue between diet groups. Further research into carrot-derived bioactive compounds and their mechanisms of action is warranted for developing effective dietary strategies against T2D.","Animals; Daucus carota; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Mice; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Male; Diet, High-Fat; Glucose Tolerance Test; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Insulin Resistance; Blood Glucose; Gene Expression Regulation; Diet, Fat-Restricted; PPAR gamma; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"
39625902,dogs,9615,glycoprotein,,Evaluation of the immune status of dogs vaccinated against rabies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using crude preparations of insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding the rabies virus glycoprotein gene.,"Evaluation of the effectiveness of vaccination of animals against rabies is not routinely implemented. In cases where it is carried out, the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) or the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test are the recommended tests. However, both of these tests require handling of live rabies virus (RABV), and are cumbersome to perform. In view of this, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been proposed as a surrogate test; however, availability of appropriate antigen is a major impediment for the development of ELISAs to detect anti-rabies antibodies. The most widely used antigen is the RABV glycoprotein (G) purified from cell culture-propagated virus, which requires a biosafety level 3 containment. The alternative is to use recombinantly expressed G, which needs to be to be properly glycosylated and folded to serve as the best antigen. The most suitable system for its production is the baculovirus expression system (BVES). However, purification of RABV G is challenging. We therefore tested partially purified preparations in the form of extracts of insect cells infected with baculovirus expressing RABV G, against sera from vaccinated dogs in an indirect ELISA. The results showed good concordance against RFFIT, with sensitivity and specificity of 90.48% and 80.00%, respectively. The system may be used for quick screening to determine the presence and an approximate level of antibodies, and can be modified to enable monitoring of mass dog vaccination programs, as well as to facilitate certification of dogs intended for international travel and transportation.","Animals; Dogs; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Rabies virus; Rabies Vaccines; Rabies; Baculoviridae; Glycoproteins; Antibodies, Viral; Vaccination; Antigens, Viral; Dog Diseases; Viral Envelope Proteins; Recombinant Proteins"

This method enables rapid quantification of deletions, insertions, and substitutions, the probability of each mutation error, and their locations in the replicated sequences. Amplification techniques tested were conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with varying levels of polymerase fidelity (OneTaq, Phusion, and Q5) as well as rolling circle amplification (RCA) with Phi29 polymerase. Plasmid amplification using bacteria was also assessed. By analyzing the distribution of errors in a large set of sequences for each sample, we examined the heterogeneity and mode of errors in each sample. This analysis revealed that Q5 and Phusion polymerases exhibited the lowest error rates observed in the amplified DNA. As a secondary validation, we analyzed the emission spectra of sfGFP fluorescent proteins synthesized with amplified DNA using cell free expression. Error-prone polymerase chain reactions confirmed the dependency of reporter protein emission spectra peak broadness to DNA error rates. The presented nanopore sequencing methods serve as a roadmap to quantify the accuracy of other gene amplification techniques, as they are discovered, enabling more homogenous cell-free expression of desired proteins.",Nanopore Sequencing; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Polymerase Chain Reaction; DNA; Plasmids; Green Fluorescent Proteins

Additionally, it serves as a production platform to test vaccines and other valuable substances. Among its approximately 3.1 Gb genome, 57 583 genes have been annotated within a 61 Mb region. We created a comprehensive and easy-to-use platform to use transcriptomes for modern annotation. These tools allow to visualize gene expression profiles, draw molecular evolutionary phylogenetic trees of gene families, perform functional enrichment analyses, and facilitate output downloads. To demonstrate their utility, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of enzymes within the nicotine biosynthesis pathway, a secondary metabolic pathway characteristic of the Nicotiana genus. Using the developed tool, expression profiles of the nicotine biosynthesis pathway genes were generated. The expression patterns of eight gene groups in the pathway were strongly expressed in the roots and weakly expressed in leaves and flowers of N. benthamiana. The results were consistent with the established gene expression profiles in Nicotiana tabacum and provided insights into gene family composition and expression trends. The compilation of this database tool can facilitate genetic analysis of N. benthamiana in the future.","Nicotiana; Transcriptome; Genome, Plant; Internet; Phylogeny; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Expression Profiling; Nicotine; Plant Leaves; Databases, Genetic"
39625987,Mammarenavirus,1653394,NMT1,4836,Targeting n-myristoyltransferases promotes a pan-Mammarenavirus inhibition through the degradation of the Z matrix protein.,"Several Old World and New World Mammarenavirus are responsible for hemorrhagic fever in humans. These enveloped viruses have a bi-segmented ambisense RNA genome that encodes four proteins. All Mammarenavirus identified to date share a common dependency on myristoylation: the addition of the C14 myristic acid on the N-terminal G2 residue on two of their proteins. The myristoylation of the Z matrix protein is required for viral particle budding, while the myristoylation of the signal peptide to the envelope glycoproteins is important for the entry mechanism. Using Mopeia virus as a model, we characterized the interaction of the Z matrix protein with the N-Myristoyltransferases (NMT) 1 and 2, the two enzymes responsible for myristoylation in mammals. While both enzymes were capable to interact with Z, we showed that only NMT1 was important for the production of viral progeny, the endogenous expression of NMT2 being insufficient to make up for NMT1 in its absence. Using the high affinity inhibitors of NMTs, IMP1088 and DDD85646, we demonstrated a strong, dose dependent and specific inhibition at the nanomolar range for all Mammarenavirus tested, including the highly pathogenic Lassa, Machupo, Junin and Lujo viruses. Mechanistically, IMP1088 and DDD85646 blocked the interaction between Z and both NMTs, preventing myristoylation and further viral particle formation, egress and spread. Unexpectedly, we found that the matrix protein devoid of myristate, despite being fully translated, did not accumulate as the other viral proteins in infected cells but was instead degraded in a proteasome- and autophagy-independent manner.

39614804,elasmobranchs,7778,,,Heterochrony and Oophagy Underlie the Evolution of Giant Filter-Feeding Lamniform Sharks.,"Evolutionary transitions toward gigantic body sizes have profound consequences for the structure and dynamics of ecological networks. Among elasmobranchs (sharks and rays), gigantism has evolved on several occasions, most notably in the iconic Megalodon (Otodus megalodon†) and the extant whale shark (Rhincodon typus), basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus), and megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios), all of which reach total lengths exceeding 6 m and, in some cases, reach 21 m or more. Comparative phylogenetic studies suggest that filter feeding and heterothermy provide two alternative evolutionary pathways leading to gigantism in sharks. These selection-based explanations for gigantism are important; however, our understanding of evolutionary transitions in body size is fundamentally constrained without a proximate, mechanistic understanding of how the suite of adaptations necessary to facilitate gigantism evolved. Here we propose the heterochrony hypothesis for the evolution of the giant filter-feeding shark ecomorphotype. We suggest that craniofacial adaptations for oophagy in embryonic stages of lamniform sharks are retained through ontogeny in C. maximus and M. pelagios by paedomorphosis, resulting in an enlarged head and mouth relative to the rest of the body, even in adulthood. This change in developmental timing enables these taxa to optimize prey acquisition, which is thought to be the limiting factor for the evolution of gigantism in filter-feeding marine vertebrates. We discuss the concordance of this hypothesis with current developmental, morphological, and evolutionary data, and we suggest future means by which the hypothesis could be tested.",Animals; Sharks; Biological Evolution; Body Size; Feeding Behavior; Phylogeny
39614880,koala,38626,,,Spatial variation in toll-like receptor diversity in koala populations across their geographic distribution.,"The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an iconic Australian species that is listed as endangered in the northern parts of its range due to loss of habitat, disease, and road deaths. Diseases contribute significantly to the decline of koala populations, primarily Chlamydia and koala retrovirus. The distribution of these diseases across the species' range, however, is not even. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in innate immunity by recognising and responding to various pathogens. Variations in TLR genes can influence an individual's susceptibility or resistance to infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to identify koala TLR diversity across the east coast of Australia using 413 re-sequenced genomes at 30 × coverage. We identified 45 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) leading to 51 alleles within ten TLR genes. Our results show that the diversity of TLR genes in the koala forms four distinct genetic groups, which are consistent with the diversity of the koala major histocompatibility complex (MHC), another key immune gene family. The bioinformatics approach presented here has broad applicability to other threatened species with existing genomic resources.","Phascolarctidae; Toll-Like Receptors; Animals; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Australia; Genetic Variation; Phylogeny; Alleles"

Black-headed gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) frequently use WWTPs and may be vectors for AMR. We used GPS tracking data for 39 gulls for up to 8 months, combined with a shedding curve, to study sources and dispersal distances of AMR in Iberia. The gulls used 21 different WWTPs (684 visits) and three landfills (21 visits). Areas of high risk of AMR dissemination were an average of 25 km from the infection source, with a maximum of 500 km. Solar saltworks and natural waterbodies were particularly exposed to AMR dissemination, followed by agriculture, sports facilities, and tourist beaches. There was important variability between individual gulls in their habitat specialization, and which WWTPs they visited. Studying the spatial movements of gulls after visiting WWTPs and landfills helps pinpoint sensitive locations where pathogen transmission is most likely.","Charadriiformes; Animals; Wastewater; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Water Purification; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Waste Disposal Facilities"
39615039,sorghum,4558,,,Development of vegetative oil sorghum: From lab-to-field.,"Biomass crops engineered to accumulate energy-dense triacylglycerols (TAG or 'vegetable oils') in their vegetative tissues have emerged as potential feedstocks to meet the growing demand for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike oil palm and oilseed crops, the current commercial sources of TAG, vegetative tissues, such as leaves and stems, only transiently accumulate TAG. In this report, we used grain (Texas430 or TX430) and sugar-accumulating 'sweet' (Ramada) genotypes of sorghum, a high-yielding, environmentally resilient biomass crop, to accumulate TAG in leaves and stems. We initially tested several gene combinations for a 'push-pull-protect' strategy. The top TAG-yielding constructs contained five oil transgenes for a sorghum WRINKLED1 transcription factor ('push'), a Cuphea viscosissima diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT; 'pull'), a modified sesame oleosin ('protect') and two combinations of specialized Cuphea lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases and medium-chain acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterases. Though intended to generate oils with medium-chain fatty acids, engineered lines accumulated oleic acid-rich oil to amounts of up to 2.5% DW in leaves and 2.0% DW in stems in the greenhouse, 36-fold and 49-fold increases relative to wild-type (WT) plants, respectively. Under field conditions, the top-performing event accumulated TAG to amount to 5.5% DW in leaves and 3.5% DW in stems, 78-fold and 58-fold increases, respectively, relative to WT TX430. Transcriptomic and fluxomic analyses revealed potential bottlenecks for increased TAG accumulation. Overall, our studies highlight the utility of a lab-to-field pipeline coupled with systems biology studies to deliver high vegetative oil sorghum for SAF and renewable diesel production.","Sorghum; Plant Oils; Plants, Genetically Modified; Triglycerides; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Plant Stems"
39615325,goose,8847,,,Molecular mechanisms underlying age-dependent effects of rearing system on the goose testicular development and semen quality.,"As an important non-genetic factor, the rearing system has significant effects on male poultry reproductive system development. However, compared with other poultry such as chickens and ducks, less is known about the effects and mechanisms of rearing system on the gander reproductive organ development and semen quality. In the present study, the testicular morphological, histological, and transcriptomic responses of three goose breeds to the two dryland rearing systems (i.e., cage rearing system, CRS and net-floor mixed rearing system, MRS) were systematically analyzed and compared. Results from histomorphological analysis demonstrated that the effects of rearing system on the gander testicular development were age-dependent, and moreover, the CRS may be more conducive than MRS to the testicular development and semen quality during the period from post-hatch week 10 to week 43. At week 30, compared to Sichuan White goose (SW), the rearing system showed more pronounced effects on the testicular size, weight, and organ index of Gang goose (GE) and Landes goose (LD). However, such effects were mitigated in LD and even reversed in GE at week 43. Meanwhile, most testicular histological parameters of three goose breeds were higher under MRS than under CRS at week 30, while the converse was seen in some histological parameters of either GE or LD at week 43. Moreover, the semen quality was generally better under CRS than under MRS at week 43. Through comparative transcriptomics analysis, the Wnt signaling pathway together with several involved hub genes were identified to have important roles in mediating the effects of rearing system on the goose testicular development. Moreover, the metabolism-related, cell cycle, and Wnt signaling pathways could be partially responsible for differences in the goose breed-related testicular development and semen quality under CRS, where a number of genes involved in meiosis could have crucial roles. These results would not only provide novel insights into the effects and mechanisms of rearing system on male poultry reproductive performance, but they would also be helpful for the optimization and selection of dryland rearing systems in male geese.","Animals; Male; Geese; Testis; Semen Analysis; Animal Husbandry; Age Factors; Transcriptome; Housing, Animal"

39616174,Zymomonas mobilis,542,,,Paradigm of engineering recalcitrant non-model microorganism with dominant metabolic pathway as a biorefinery chassis.,"The development and implementation of microbial chassis cells have profound impacts on circular economy. Non-model bacterium Zymomonas mobilis is an excellent chassis owing to its extraordinary industrial characteristics. Here, the genome-scale metabolic model iZM516 is improved and updated by integrating enzyme constraints to simulate the dynamics of flux distribution and guide pathway design. We show that the innate dominant ethanol pathway of Z. mobilis restricts the titer and rate of these biochemicals. A dominant-metabolism compromised intermediate-chassis (DMCI) strategy is then developed through introducing low toxicity but cofactor imbalanced 2,3-butanediol pathway, and a recombinant D-lactate producer is constructed to produce more than 140.92 g/L and 104.6 g/L D-lactate (yield > 0.97 g/g) from glucose and corncob residue hydrolysate, respectively. Additionally, techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) demonstrate the commercialization feasibility and greenhouse gas reduction capability of lignocellulosic D-lactate.

39617774,Cataglyphis velox,72786,,,Ants integrate proprioception as well as visual context and efference copies to make robust predictions.,"Forward models are mechanisms enabling an agent to predict the sensory outcomes of its actions. They can be implemented through efference copies: copies of motor signals inhibiting the expected sensory stimulation, literally canceling the perceptual outcome of the predicted action. In insects, efference copies are known to modulate optic flow detection for flight control in flies. Here we investigate whether forward models account for the detection of optic flow in walking ants, and how the latter is integrated for locomotion control. We mounted Cataglyphis velox ants in a virtual reality setup and manipulated the relationship between the ants' movements and the optic flow perceived. Our results show that ants compute predictions of the optic flow expected according to their own movements.

39617805,Streptomyces fulvorobeus,284028,,,Discovery of structurally diverse sesquiterpenoids from Streptomyces fulvorobeus isolated from Elephas maximus feces and their antifungal activities.,"Thirty-six structurally diverse sesquiterpenoids, including caryolanes (1-12), germacranes (13-16), isodaucane (17), cadinanes (18-22), epicubenols (23, 24), oplopanane (25), pallenanes (26, 27), and eudesmanes (28-36), were isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces fulvorobeus derived from Elephas maximus feces. Pallenane is a kind of rarely reported sesquiterpene with a distinctive C5/C3 bicyclic skeleton and was firstly found from microbial source. The structures of fifteen new compounds (1-4, 13-15, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25-28) were established through detailed spectroscopic data analysis, which included data from experimental and calculated ECD spectra as well as Mosher's reagent derivative method. Compound 34 exhibited moderate antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii with MIC values of 50 μg/mL. It effectively inhibited biofilm formation and destroyed the preformed biofilm, as well as hindered the adhesion of Cryptococcus species. The current work would enrich the chemical diversity of sesquiterpenoid family.",

Duplicated genes often exhibit functional divergence due to competition for the identical miRNA binding sites. Kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) is an economically significant horticultural crop renowned for its distinctive flavor, which is largely attributable to elevated citrate levels during fruit development. However, the mechanisms through which miRNA-targeted modules evolve following duplication events and regulate citrate biosynthesis, thereby influencing the unique flavor profile of kiwifruits, remain poorly understood.","MicroRNAs; Actinidia; Fruit; Citric Acid; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Duplication; RNA, Plant; Plant Proteins"
39617958,Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,5180,,,SsPtc3 Modulating SsSmk1-MAPK and Autophagy to Facilitate Growth and Pathogenicity in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.,"The compound appressoria of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can produce cell wall-degrading enzymes, effectors and toxins, which promote penetration and the death of host cells. Subsequently, invasive hyphae (IH) branch rapidly as necrotrophic growth and disease symptoms are observed. S. sclerotiorum can respond to complex stresses and regulate its metabolism to adapt to the external environment. Here we demonstrated that type 2C Ser/Thr phosphatase (PP2C) SsPtc3 responds to nutritional, osmotic, cell wall and oxidative stresses. Loss of function ΔSsptc3 mutants displayed defects in mycelial growth, sclerotia formation and reduced virulence. Phosphoproteomic analyses revealed that SsPtc3 is involved in autophagy and MAPK signalling pathways. We obtained evidence that SsPtc3 negatively modulates the phosphorylation of SsSmk1. SsSmk1 is essential for mycelial growth, compound appressorium formation and pathogenicity, SsPtc3 modulated phosphorylation homeostasis of SsSmk1 to maintain hyphal growth. SsPtc3 interacted with SsAtg1 to influence autophagic flux under starvation. Taken together, these results reveal that SsPtc3 responds to various stresses that modulate autophagy and phosphorylation of SsSmk1-MAPK, which facilitates the growth and virulence of S. sclerotiorum.","Ascomycota; Autophagy; Fungal Proteins; Phosphorylation; Virulence; Hyphae; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Plant Diseases; Protein Phosphatase 2C; Mycelium; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; MAP Kinase Signaling System"

Here, we profile the function of several topoisomerase poisons, which are small molecules that stabilize topoisomerase enzymatic intermediates, where topoisomerase enzymes are covalently bound at chromosomal DNA breaks. As previously observed, we found that the topoisomerase poisons camptothecin (CPT), doxorubicin (DOX), and etoposide (ETO) increased AAV transduction in cultured cell models. DOX and ETO, small molecules that specifically inhibit type II topoisomerases and so stabilize double-strand breaks, were found to boost integration of AAV DNA into the host cell chromosome. Analysis of integration site distributions showed that integration targeting was altered, so that integration in the presence of DOX or ETO was favored near actively transcribed regions. Locations of topoisomerase II binding sites were inferred from genomic data using a novel machine learning platform, and integration in the presence of DOX or ETO was found to be selectively favored near inferred topoisomerase II binding sites. These data help guide development of improved transduction protocols using these reagents and establish that DOX and ETO can control AAV integration targeting.",

39618971,bacteria,629395,,,Development of photoactive biomaterial using modified fullerene nanoparticles.,"Medical device-associated biofilm infections continue to pose a significant challenge for public health. These infections arise from biofilm accumulation on the device, hampering the antimicrobial treatment. In response, significant efforts have been made to design functional polymeric devices that possess antimicrobial properties, limiting or preventing biofilm formation. However, until now none of the strategies showed a promissory effect. Thus, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has been shown as a promising candidate to overcome this problem. Photosensitizers (PS) are the main key component for aPDT and fullerenes have been chosen as PS due to their good quantum yields and lifetimes spans. In this study, polylactic acid (PLA) surface was modified with fullerene (C60) and reaction was proven by XPS analysis. The biopolymer surface was characterized by AFM, SEM, and water contact angle measurements. The obtained results imply that the highest fullerene precipitation was attained when PLA was modified with ethylenediamine (EDA) before the reaction with C60, as the highest carbon increase was identified using XPS following reaction with C60. While samples' hydrophobicity decreased after PLA modification with EDA, it increased after fullerene precipitation. Which implies that bacteria have a lower propensity to attach. Although the surface of the samples became smoother following PLA modification with EDA and reaction with 0.1% C60 precipitation, with 1% C60 precipitation the surface roughness was comparable to unmodified PLA, according to AFM and SEM analyses. Fullerene-based biopolymers could potentially be used in aPDT to make antimicrobial surfaces or medical devices.",

The common spontaneous regression of CCH makes it an interesting model in comparative oncology research. Previous studies have indicated that anti-tumor immune responses may be involved, but details remain speculative to date. Here, we asked which specific immuno-oncological dynamics underlie spontaneous regression of CCH on mRNA and protein levels. QuantSeq 3' mRNA sequencing with functional over-representation analysis and an nCounter RNA hybridization assay were employed on 21 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded CCH samples representing three different tumor stages (dataset information: GSE261387-Immuno-Oncologic Profiling by Stage-Dependent Transcriptome and Proteome Analyses of Spontaneously Regressing Canine Cutaneous Histiocytoma-OmicsDI).

In this study, we explored the potentialities of the sustainable oilseed crop camelina to provide dietary proteins and to prepare oil-in-water emulsions. An innovative green refinery process, including the removal by ultrasound of the mucilage attached at the surface of the seeds and extraction by grinding in water at pH 8, was used to recover aqueous extracts containing camelina seed proteins. These proteins, mainly composed of the 11S globulin cruciferins and the 2S albumin napins, contained the nine essential amino acids of nutritional interest. Camelina seed proteins exhibited low solubility in the range of pH 5.5-2, attributed to the cruciferins. Oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by camelina seed proteins revealed the preferential adsorption of napin at the oil/water interface and exhibited physical instability below pH 7. Homogenization of the whole aqueous extracts containing oil bodies (OBs) induced the adsorption of cruciferins and napins together with oleosins at the surface of homogenized OBs, and their sedimentation below pH 6.5. Camelina seed proteins adsorbed at the oil/water interface governed the surface properties of the oil droplets and homogenized OBs as well as the physical stability of the emulsions as a function of pH. This work brings new insights into the potentialities of camelina seed proteins recovered by aqueous extraction that may serve as natural plant-based functional ingredients in the food industry and that will contribute to the development of innovative and sustainable plant-based food emulsions.",

39620068,cocoa,3641,,,The role of household labour for sustainable intensification in smallholder systems: a case study in cocoa farming systems.,"Sustainable agricultural intensification aims at increasing yields on existing agricultural land without negative environmental impacts. Managing pests and diseases contributes to increasing yields. Without synthetic pesticides, this management is labour intensive. Smallholder farming systems heavily rely on manual and household labour, which will be affected by future demographic changes. Knowledge on how these changes will affect sustainable intensification is limited. Based on a case study of Ugandan cocoa farms, we tested the impact of increased household labour availability on pest and disease management (PDM) practices and pesticide use. We made use of a unique quasi-experimental design, in which household labour increased during the national COVID-19 lockdowns as children did not attend school and family members returned from cities. Our interview data from 2019 to 2021 showed that household labour availability increased on average by 0.8 (±2.5) household members and 16% of labour days per hectare. Using different regression models complemented with qualitative insights, we found that the uptake of alternative PDM practices significantly reduced pesticide quantities and expenditures. The implementation of alternative PDM practices was only weakly influenced by household labour availability and increased with farmer training and trust in alternative practices. These results imply that alternative PDM practices are an important pillar for production with little or without synthetic pesticides and their adoption requires support and incentives, especially on labour or resource-constrained farms.",

Approximately, 296 million patients have been chronically infected with the virus, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although HBV polymerase (HBVpol, pol) plays a pivotal role in HBV replication and must be a definite therapeutic target. The problems are that the detailed functions and intracellular dynamics of HBVpol remain unclear. Here, we constructed two kinds of tagged HBVpol, PA-tagged and HiBiT-tagged pol, and the HBV-producing vectors. Each PA tag and HiBiT tag were inserted into N-terminus of spacer region on HBVpol open reading frame. Transfection of the plasmids into HepG2 cells led to production of HBV. These tagged HBVpol were detectable in HBV replicating cells and pol-HiBiT enabled quantitative analysis. Furthermore, these recombinant HBV were infectious to primary human hepatocytes. Thus, we successfully designed infectious and replication-competent recombinant HBV harboring detectable tagged HBVpol. Such infectious recombinant HBV will provide a novel tool to study HBVpol dynamics and develop new therapeutics against HBV.","Humans; Hepatitis B virus; Virus Replication; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatocytes; Gene Products, pol; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Hepatitis B; Genetic Vectors; Plasmids; Transfection; DNA, Viral; Open Reading Frames"

Although mechanistic models of HIV play a key role in evaluating intervention strategies, social conditions are typically not part of the modeling framework. Challenges include the unavailability of coherent statistical data for social conditions and behaviors. We developed a method, combining undirected graphical modeling with copula methods, to integrate disparate data sources, to estimate joint probability distributions for social conditions and behaviors. We incorporated these in a national-level network model, Progression and Transmission of HIV (PATH 4.0), to simulate behaviors as functions of social conditions and HIV transmissions as a function of behaviors. As a demonstration for the potential applications of such a model, we conducted two hypothetical what-if intervention analyses to estimate the impact of an ideal 100% efficacious intervention strategy. The first analysis modeled care behavior (using viral suppression as proxy) as a function of depression, neighborhood, housing, poverty, education, insurance, and employment status. The second modeled sexual behaviors (number of partners and condom-use) as functions of employment, housing, poverty, and education status, among persons who exchange sex. HIV transmissions and disease progression were then simulated as functions of behaviors to estimate incidence reductions. Social determinants are key drivers of many infectious and non-infectious diseases.

39621587,Aspergillus,746128,,,Synergistic potential of lopinavir and azole combinational therapy against clinically important Aspergillus species.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a widely distributed pathogen responsible for severe infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Triazoles are the primary treatments options for Aspergillus infections; however, the emergence of acquired resistance to this antifungal class is becoming a growing concern. In this study, we investigated the potential of the antiviral drug, lopinavir (LPV) to restore the susceptibility of A. fumigatus strains to a set of azoles, while also reducing the required azole dosage for treatment of susceptible isolates. The combination of LPV with either itraconazole (ITC) or posaconazole (POS) demonstrated potent synergistic interactions against 16 out of 23 (~70%) and 21 out of 23 (~91%) A. fumigatus isolates, respectively. Moreover, the combination showed synergistic activity against other clinically important Aspergillus species, including A. niger, A. flavus, and A. brasiliensis. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) for the combinations ranged from 0.18 to 0.313 for ITC and 0.091 to 0.313 for POS, indicating strong synergistic effects. Further investigation revealed that efflux pump inhibition contributed to the synergy observed between azole and LPV. Morphological examination of the fungal cells subjected to this combinational therapy at sub-inhibitory doses showed the presence of carbohydrate granules/patches. The identification of LPV as a promising adjunct therapy holds promise for addressing the emerging challenge of azole resistance in Aspergillus species and improving treatment outcomes for patients.","Drug Synergism; Lopinavir; Antifungal Agents; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Aspergillus; Itraconazole; Humans; Azoles; Drug Resistance, Fungal; Triazoles; Drug Therapy, Combination; Aspergillus fumigatus; Aspergillosis"

To assess the potential impacts of climate change on insectivorous bats and the implications on small-scale farming of indigenous communities in the Chiapas Highlands in southern Mexico we developed a three-step protocol: (1) projecting distribution shifts of insectivorous bats under climate change scenarios using non-dispersal and limited-full dispersal assumptions, (2) using official information to estimate the average economic value of conducting chemical pest control in crops at a state level, (3) surveying small-scale farmers to estimate the local economic value of pest control and determine how bats are perceived by small-scale farmers. Our models project shifts in bat species due to climate change. Given that new suitable climatic areas are also projected, if we assume a limited-full dispersal scenario, bats might not be as at risk by climate change, but shifting their distribution to more suitable habitats will probably affect the dynamic of the ecosystem service they provide. The official estimated value of chemical pest control is $15.15 USD/ha, while the estimated cost resulting from a hybrid survey with small-scale farmers was $47.53 USD/ha. The difference in cost could be related to an overuse of insecticides for pest control or an increase in price due to reduced accessibility. Sixty percent of surveyed farmers perceived a decline in bat populations, 68% were unaware of the benefits that bats provide to their crops, 51% believe that bats are mainly hematophagous, and 10% recognize that people harm or kill bats. A new approach including communicating small-scale farmers in their native languages the benefits that insectivorous bats provide along with a pest management strategy for the efficient use of insecticides needs to be implemented.",Animals; Chiroptera; Climate Change; Mexico; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Pest Control
39621646,human papillomavirus,10566,TLR2,7097,Designing and immunomolecular analysis of a new broad-spectrum multiepitope vaccine against divergent human papillomavirus types.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV), which is transmitted through sexual activity, is the primary cause of cervical cancer and the fourth most common type of cancer in women. In this study, an immunoinformatics approach was employed to predict immunodominant epitopes from a diverse array of antigens with the ultimate objective of designing a potent multiepitope vaccine against multiple HPV types. Immunodominant B cell, cytotoxic T cell (CTL), and helper T cell (HTL) epitopes were predicted using bioinformatics tools These epitopes were subsequently analyzed using various immunoinformatics tools, and those that exhibited high antigenicity, immunogenicity, non-allergenicity, non-toxicity, and excellent conservation were selected. The selected epitopes were linked with appropriate linkers and adjuvants to formulate a broad-spectrum multiepitope vaccine candidate against HPV. The stability of the multiepitope vaccine candidate was confirmed through structural analysis, and docking results indicated a high affinity for Toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4). Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated a persistent interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with the multiepitope vaccine candidate. In silico immunological simulations showed that three injections of the multiepitope vaccine candidate resulted in high levels of B- and T-cell immune responses. Moreover, the in silico cloning results indicated that the multiepitope vaccine candidate could be expressed in substantial amounts in E. coli. The results of this study imply that designing a broad-spectrum vaccine against various HPV types using computational methods is plausible; however, experimental validation and safety testing to confirm the findings is essential.","Humans; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Female; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Papillomavirus Infections; Papillomaviridae; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Toll-Like Receptor 4; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Epitopes; Immunodominant Epitopes; Human Papillomavirus Viruses"

39621751,P. aeruginosa,287,,,Serotype switching in Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST111 enhances adhesion and virulence.,"Evolution of the highly successful and multidrug resistant clone ST111 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa involves serotype switching from O-antigen O4 to O12. How expression of a different O-antigen serotype alters pathogen physiology to enable global dissemination of this high-risk clone-type is not understood. Here, we engineered isogenic laboratory and clinical P. aeruginosa strains that express the different O-antigen gene clusters to assess the correlation of structural differences of O4 and O12 O-antigens to pathogen-relevant phenotypic traits. We show that serotype O12 is associated with enhanced adhesion, type IV pili dependent twitching motility, and tolerance to host defense molecules and serum. Moreover, we find that serotype O4 is less virulent compared to O12 in an acute murine pneumonia infection in terms of both colonization and survival rate. Finally, we find that these O-antigen effects may be explained by specific biophysical properties of the serotype repeat unit found in O4 and O12, and by differences in membrane stability between O4 and O12 expressing cells. The results demonstrate that differences in O-antigen sugar composition can affect P. aeruginosa pathogenicity traits, and provide a better understanding of the potential selective advantages that underlie serotype switching and emergence of serotype O12 ST111.",Pseudomonas aeruginosa; O Antigens; Mice; Animals; Pseudomonas Infections; Virulence; Serogroup; Bacterial Adhesion; Female
39621766,sesame,4182,,,The first complete mitochondrial genome of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.).,"Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.), an important oilseed crop, has garnered considerable interest. The nuclear and chloroplast genomes of sesame have been extensively applied to sesame genetics and genomics research. The mitochondrial (mt) genome of sesame, however, has not been sequenced and annotated. In order to solve this issue, we reconstructed the first mt genome of sesame using third-generation sequencing data. The sesame mt genome was 724,998 bp in size and had 22 circular chromosomes. A total of 66 genes were annotated, including 37 protein-coding genes, 26 transfer RNAs, and three ribosomal RNAs. We investigated the codon usage patterns, simple sequence repeats, long tandem repeats, and dispersed repeats of the sesame mt genome. Furthermore, we investigated the DNA transfer from chloroplast to mitochondrion and compared the sesame mt genome to two other Lamiales mt genomes. Given the economic importance of this crop, our presented sesame mt genome is a valuable genomic resource and will allow for more comprehensive studies on sesame and related species.",
39621796,NDV,11176,AIF,9131,Newcastle disease virus infection induces parthanatos in tumor cells via calcium waves.,"Parthanatos is distinct from caspase-dependent apoptosis in that it does not necessitate the activation of caspase cascades; Instead, it relies on the translocation of Apoptosis-inducing Factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the nucleus, resulting in nuclear DNA fragmentation. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is an oncolytic virus that selectively targets and kills tumor cells by inducing cell apoptosis. It has been reported that NDV triggers classic apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. In this study, we observed that NDV infection induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), which caused a rapid release of endogenous calcium ions (Ca2+). This cascade of events resulted in mitochondrial depolarization, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and structural remodeling of the mitochondria. The overload of Ca2+ also initiated an increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability, facilitating the transfer of AIF to the nucleus to induce apoptosis. Damaged mitochondria produced excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further exacerbated mitochondrial damage and increased mitochondrial membrane permeability, thus promoting additional intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and ultimately triggering an ROS burst. Collectively, these findings indicate that NDV infection promotes excessive calcium accumulation and ROS generation, leading to mitochondrial damage that releases more calcium and ROS, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates AIF-dependent parthanatos. This study not only provides a novel perspective on the oncolytic mechanism of NDV but also highlights new targets for antiviral research.","Newcastle disease virus; Humans; Apoptosis; Calcium; Mitochondria; Reactive Oxygen Species; Parthanatos; Apoptosis Inducing Factor; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Calcium Signaling; Cell Line, Tumor; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Newcastle Disease; Animals; Neoplasms"
39621921,HIV,11676,,,Very broad distribution of β sheet registries of the HIV gp41 fusion peptide supports mutational robustness for fusion and infection.,"HIV, like other membrane-enveloped viruses, has protein spikes that include a fusion peptide (Fp) segment that binds the host cell membrane and plays a critical role in fusion (joining) viral and cell membranes. The HIV Fp is the ~23 N-terminal residues of the gp41 spike protein. Fp adopts intermolecular antiparallel β sheet structure when lipid fraction cholesterol ≈0.3, which is comparable to host cells. Rotational-echo double-resonance NMR was applied to probe the registries (alignments) of adjacent Fp molecules in membrane-bound sheets. The data were fitted to determine quantitative populations, f(t)'s, of individual antiparallel registries indexed by t, the number of residues in the registry.

39622791,H. pylori,210,cytotoxin-associated gene A,,Infection of Helicobacter pylori contributes to the progression of gastric cancer through ferroptosis.,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative pathogen that colonizes gastric epithelial cells, and its chronic infection is the primary risk factor for the development of gastric cancer (GC). Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of cell death characterized by intracellular lipid peroxide accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) imbalance. There is evidence suggesting that pathogens can manipulate ferroptosis to facilitate their replication, transmission, and pathogenesis. However, the interaction between ferroptosis and H. pylori infection requires further elucidation. We reviewed the mechanism of ferroptosis and found that H. pylori virulence factors such as cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), neutrophil-activating protein A (NapA), superoxide dismutase B (SodB), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (gGT), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and outer inflammatory protein A (OipA) affected glutathione (GSH), ROS, and lipid oxidation to regulate ferroptosis. It also affected the progression of GC by regulating ferroptosis-related indicators through abnormal gene expression after H. pylori infected gastric mucosa cells. Finally, we discuss the potential application value of ferroptosis inducers, inhibitors and other drugs in treating H. pylori-infected GC patients while acknowledging that their interactions are still not fully understood.",
39622833,Candida albicans,5476,TYK2,7297,Lack of TYK2 signaling enhances host resistance to Candida albicans skin infection.,"Candida albicans is the most common human fungal pathogen, causing diseases ranging from local to life-threating systemic infections. Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), a crucial mediator in several cytokine signaling pathways, has been associated with protective functions in various microbial infections. However, its specific contribution in the immune response to fungal infections has remained elusive. In this study, we show that mice lacking TYK2 or its enzymatic activity exhibit enhanced resistance to C. albicans skin infections, limiting fungal spread and accelerating wound healing. Impaired TYK2-signaling prompted the formation of a distinctive layer of necrotic neutrophils around the fungal pathogens. Transcriptomic analysis revealed TYK2's pivotal role in regulating interferon-inducible genes in neutrophils, thereby impacting their antifungal capacity during infection. Furthermore, we show that TYK2-dependent interferon-gamma (IFNγ) production contributes to fungal dissemination from the skin to the kidneys. Our study uncovers a hitherto unrecognized detrimental role of TYK2 in cutaneous C. albicans infections.","Animals; Candida albicans; TYK2 Kinase; Signal Transduction; Mice; Interferon-gamma; Neutrophils; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Skin; Candidiasis; Female; Wound Healing; Candidiasis, Cutaneous; Male"

39623167,Naegleria gruberi,5762,,,Mechanisms of axoneme and centriole elimination in Naegleria gruberi.,"The early branching eukaryote Naegleria gruberi can transform transiently from an amoeboid life form lacking centrioles and flagella to a flagellate life form where these elements are present, followed by reversion to the amoeboid state. The mechanisms imparting elimination of axonemes and centrioles during this reversion process are not known. Here, we uncover that flagella primarily fold onto the cell surface and fuse within milliseconds with the plasma membrane. Once internalized, axonemes are severed by Spastin into similarly-sized fragments that are then enclosed by membranes, before their contents are eliminated through the lysosomal pathway. Moreover, we discovered that centrioles undergo progressive K63 autophagy-linked poly-ubiquitination and K48 proteasome-promoting poly-ubiquitination, and that such ubiquitination occurs next to centriolar microtubules. Most centrioles are eliminated in either lysosomes or the cytoplasm in a lysosomal- and proteasome-dependent manner. Strikingly, we uncover in addition that centrioles can be shed in the extracellular milieu and taken up by other cells. Collectively, these findings reveal fundamental mechanisms governing the elimination of essential cellular constituents in Naegleria that may operate broadly in eukaryotic systems.",Centrioles; Naegleria; Lysosomes; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Axoneme; Ubiquitination; Autophagy; Flagella; Protozoan Proteins; Microtubules

Effective delivery and sustained presence of chemokines at the tumor site is essential for recruiting and activating immune cells to exert anti-tumor effects. In this study, we report a genetically engineered bacterial cell factory designed for the continuous production of chemokine CCL21 in a controlled manner. To decrease the formation of infusion bodies (IBs) in bacteria, we used thioredoxin (Trx) as the fusion partner and cloned at N-terminal of the target protein.

Many studies have confirmed that there is a close relationship between IDD and senescence and apoptosis, and autophagy can combat apoptosis and senescence. Spatholobi caulis (SC) is an herb that contains various active compounds that are effective in tissue repair and regeneration, but it has not been explored in field of IDD. In this study, it was first found that SC can boost autophagy and reduce the apoptosis and senescence of Nucleus pulposus cell (NPCs). However, our animal studies revealed limited absorption of SC. To improve the bioavailability and efficacy of SC, we developed a hydrogel incorporating quaternary ammonium chitosan (QCS) and oxidized starch (OST) as carriers for SC. The QCS-OST/SC hydrogel exhibits excellent compatibility with cells, can be easily injected, and can release SC durably. At the cellular level, the QCS-OST/SC hydrogel enhances cell viability, initiates autophagy and release of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and inhibits cellular senescence and apoptosis. The injection of the QCS-OST/SC hydrogel via microneedles (MNs) into discs had successfully diminished disc degeneration in rats, which shows that this hydrogel has broad potential in the treatment of IDD.",
39624099,Porcine deltacoronavirus,1586324,FBXW8,100156796,FBXW8 suppresses PDCoV proliferation via the NPD52-dependent autophagic degradation of a viral nucleocapsid protein.,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a newly discovered intestinal coronavirus, has rapidly spread among pigs worldwide and has shown the potential for cross-species infection. However, the interaction mechanism between PDCoV and the host's antiviral response is still poorly understood. In this study, an E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW8 was explored on PDCoV proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that PDCoV infection increases the expression of FBXW8 through p65-mediated activation of its promoter. We also discovered that FBXW8 suppresses PDCoV replication by directly targeting and inducing the degradation of the PDCoV-encoded nucleocapsid (N) protein. Interestingly, FBXW8 catalyzes the K48-linked polyubiquitination of the PDCoV N protein at a unique lysine-rich region (KR). Furthermore, we observed that the FBXW8-ubiquitinated PDCoV N protein interacts with NDP52, a cargo receptor, leading to autophagic degradation instead of proteasomal degradation. In summary, these findings reveal FBXW8 as a novel host antiviral factor involved in PDCoV infection. It mediates the NDP52-dependent autophagic degradation of the PDCoV N protein.

39625066,Vibrio,662,,,Genetic Variation in the Atlantic Bobtail Squid-Vibrio Symbiosis From the Galician Rías.,"Symbiotic marine bacteria that are transmitted through the environment are susceptible to abiotic factors (salinity, temperature, physical barriers) that can influence their ability to colonize their specific hosts. Given that many symbioses are driven by host specificity, environmentally transmitted symbionts are more susceptible to extrinsic factors depending on conditions over space and time. In order to determine whether the population structure of environmentally transmitted symbionts reflects host specificity or biogeography, we analysed the genetic structure of Sepiola atlantica (Cephalopoda: Sepiolidae) and their Vibrio symbionts (V. fischeri and V. logei) in four Galician Rías (Spain). This geographical location is characterized by a jagged coastline with a deep-sea entrance into the land, ideal for testing whether such population barriers exist due to genetic isolation. We used haplotype estimates combined with nested clade analysis to determine the genetic relatedness for both S. atlantica and Vibrio bacteria. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) were used to estimate variation within and between populations for both host and symbiont genetic data. Our analyses reveal a low percentage of variation among and between host populations, suggesting that these populations are panmictic. In contrast, Vibrio symbiont populations show certain degree of genetic structure, demonstrating that the hydrology of the rías is driving bacterial distribution (and not host specificity). Thus, for environmentally transmitted symbioses such as the sepiolid squid-Vibrio association, abiotic factors can be a major selective force for determining population structure for one of the partners.","Symbiosis; Animals; Decapodiformes; Spain; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Vibrio; Genetics, Population; Aliivibrio fischeri; Phylogeny"

39625887,Plasmodium,418103,,,"Are the Culex pipiens biotypes pipiens, molestus and their hybrids competent vectors of avian Plasmodium?","The common house mosquito Culex pipiens s.l., widely distributed in Europe, Africa, and North America has two recognized biotypes, Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and Cx. pipiens biotype molestus, which hybridize. Despite their morphological similarities, these biotypes may exhibit ecological differences. This complex ecological mosaic may affect the interaction of Cx. pipiens with pathogens like avian Plasmodium, which is transmitted to wildlife. Although the vector competence for Cx. pipiens biotype molestus has been well studied, there is a lack of studies comparing the vector competence of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and their hybrids for the transmission of avian Plasmodium. Here, we evaluated the vector competence of the Cx. pipiens biotypes pipiens, molestus and their hybrids for the transmission of two avian Plasmodium species. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on blood of wild infected birds and the presence of DNA of Plasmodium in head-thorax and saliva of mosquitoes was molecularly evaluated at 13 day-post exposure. The transmission rates (i.e., the detection of parasite DNA in mosquito saliva) for Plasmodium cathemerium were similar for the two biotypes of Cx. pipiens and their hybrids while Plasmodium relictum DNA was only found in the saliva of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens. In addition, P. cathemerium was significantly more prevalent than P. relictum in the saliva of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens. Our results suggest that avian Plasmodium is transmitted by both Cx. pipiens biotypes and their hybrids although differences could be found depending of the parasite species studied. Differences in the abundance of each biotype and their hybrids within areas characterized by distinct environmental conditions, along with variations in their blood-feeding patterns and the parasites infecting birds, could ultimately determine differences in the relevance of each Cx. pipiens biotype in the transmission of avian Plasmodium.","Animals; Culex; Plasmodium; Malaria, Avian; Mosquito Vectors; Birds; Hybridization, Genetic; Female"

This study describes the use of compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) modelling to simulate the spread of norovirus among preschool children in a classroom setting. Different intervention measures, such as isolation of infected preschoolers, handwashing and surface decontamination were modelled to quantify their effectiveness at reducing the number of children infected. We found that isolation of the sick child was the most effective single intervention to reduce transmission risk, which was 5 times more effective than handwashing. Coupled with handwashing and surface decontamination, transmission risk could be further reduced, close to zero. Findings from our study can be used to reiterate to parents and teachers on the importance of recognizing the symptoms exhibited by their unwell children and refraining from sending them to school, as this action poses a risk of transmitting norovirus to other children. In addition, our findings can be used to educate children and staff in preschools on the importance of practising good personal hygiene and regular environmental cleaning. Through this study, decision makers would be better informed on the effectivness of various risk mitigation measures at reduce the risk of norovirus transmission in preschool settings.","Humans; Norovirus; Caliciviridae Infections; Child, Preschool; Disease Outbreaks; Hand Disinfection; Gastroenteritis; Schools"

The BALB/c strain is distributed globally and is among the most commonly used inbred strains in immunology and infectious disease research. Despite being a widely distributed bacterium that causes chronic infection, Bartonella henselae infection has not been investigated in any protocol that characterizes SPF animals. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential natural infection of laboratory animals of the BALB/c lineage by B. henselae. To achieve this, ten immunocompetent BALB/c mice were obtained directly from the bioterium and euthanized for collection of samples, including blood, skin, spleen, liver, heart, eye, kidney, intestine, esophagus, and brain. DNA was extracted using a commercial kit and tested via nested PCR for the ftsZ gene, as well as conventional PCR and qualitative real-time PCR using Sybr® Green for the citrate synthase gene (gltA), all specific reactions for B. henselae. All animals showed detection of B. henselae DNA in at least two different reactions in different tissues. The sequenced amplicons showed 100 % similarity to B. henselae. The use of mice infected by B. henselae in experiments is undesirable, as the bacteria can affect several aspects of the animal's physiology and consequently influence the results of the project, especially when subjected to immunosuppression. More studies are needed to understand and confirm the natural infection in experimental animals by Bartonella spp.. To date, no additional published reports of contamination of experimental animals by these bacteria have been identified.","Animals; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Bartonella henselae; Mice; DNA, Bacterial; Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Female; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"
39615800,B. tabaci,7038,,,"SYNCAS based CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in predatory mites, whiteflies and stinkbugs.","Despite the establishment of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing protocols in a wide range of organisms, genetic engineering is still challenging for many organisms due to constraints including lethality of embryo injection, difficulties in egg/embryo collection or viviparous lifestyles. Recently, an efficient CRISPR-Cas9 method, termed SYNCAS, was developed to genetically modify spider mites and thrips species. The method is based on maternal injection of formulated CRISPR-Cas9 using saponin and BAPC. Here, we investigate whether the method can be used to perform gene editing in other arthropods such as the beneficial predatory mites Amblyseius swirskii and Phytoseiulus persimilis, and the pests Bemisia tabaci and Nezara viridula. For the predatory mites, Antp and SLC25A38 were used as target genes, while the ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster ABCG transporter white was targeted in B. tabaci and N. viridula. All species were successfully edited with the highest efficiencies (up to 39%) being obtained for B. tabaci. For A. swirskii and P. persimilis no clear phenotypes could be observed, even though SLC25A38 was successfully knocked-out. The lack of a color phenotype in SLC25A38 mutants was confirmed in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. Disruption of the target gene Antp is likely lethal in predatory mites, as no true null mutants could be recovered. For B. tabaci, KO of white resulted in orange eyes which diverges from the phenotype seen in white mutants of D. melanogaster. In the last species, N. viridula, a single phenotypic mutant could be detected having a patchy white body coloration with wild type eye coloration. Genotyping revealed a single amino acid deletion at the target site, suggesting the creation of a hypomorphic allele. To conclude, the protocols provided in this work can contribute to the genetic study of predatory mites used in biological control, as well as hemipteran pests.",Animals; Gene Editing; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Hemiptera; Mites; Insect Proteins; Female
39616203,Octopus,6643,,,Machine learning analysis of the effects of COVID-19 on migration patterns.,"This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on European tourist mobility patterns from 2019 to 2021 by conceptualizing countries as monomers emitting radiation to model and analyze their patterns through the lens of socio-economics and machine learning. By incorporating perturbations into clustering, this work evaluates the stability of mobility flux clustering under variable conditions, offering insights into the dynamics of socio-economic corridors. The results highlight distinct shifts in tourist behavior, with bimodal clustering in 2019 reflecting heterogeneous mobility patterns, whereas unimodal distributions in 2020 and 2021 indicate increased global uniformity, driven by pandemic-induced restrictions and gradual recovery. The PCA and dendrograms of the perturbed clustering reveal that tourist preferences align with GDP, cultural, and linguistic similarities, explaining regional cohesion and fragility. This study demonstrates the fragility of emerging socio-economic corridors like the Red Octopus compared to the resilience of established ones like the Blue Banana. The findings emphasize the importance of targeted policy interventions, such as strengthening transport infrastructure and fostering small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to mitigate disruptions and promote balanced regional development. By integrating perturbations into clustering, this research introduces a strong framework for assessing mobility patterns under realistic variability to enhance economic resilience and anticipate shifts in tourist behavior during global crises.",COVID-19; Humans; Machine Learning; SARS-CoV-2; Europe; Travel; Pandemics; Socioeconomic Factors

By focusing on the nsP2 protein, crucial for the virus's replication, the research utilizes computational methods identifying inhibitor compounds with high binding affinity. These promising candidates are further analyzed through 1 µs of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies, aiming to find effective inhibitors to control the chikungunya spread, leveraging Indonesia's rich biodiversity for novel anti-CHIKV therapies. The results of our study highlight the molecular mechanism of the potential of epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (EGCG) from Camelia sinensis in inhibiting nsP2 protease by binding to essential catalytic residues and exploring more energetically favorable orientations within the catalytic pocket. This dynamic binding process suggests that EGCG may disrupt the protease's catalytic functions, potentially altering domain interactions without compromising the protein's overall structure. Given nsP2's minimal homology with human proteins, the risk of cross-reactivity is reduced, making it a suitable target for CHIKV therapy. This study suggests EGCG as a prime candidate for further development as a broad-spectrum inhibitor against CHIKF.",Chikungunya virus; Catechin; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Antiviral Agents; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Humans; Chikungunya Fever; Protein Binding
39616220,bacteria,629395,,,Exposure to Pseudomonas spp. increases Anopheles gambiae insecticide resistance in a host-dependent manner.,"The microbiota of mosquitoes influences many aspects of their biology, including developmental processes, mating and sexual reproduction, immune functions, and refractoriness to pathogens. Here, we considered their role in resistance against insecticides. In particular, we assessed how larval infection of a permethrin-resistant and a sensitive colony of Anopheles gambiae by four strains belonging to three different Pseudomonas species affects several life history traits and the impact of the insecticide on adult mortality. Our data showed that all four Pseudomonas strains persisted in adults until death. The bacteria increased the likelihood that mosquitoes survived 24 h after exposure to permethrin by up to twofold. The impact of the bacteria depended on the bacterial strains and the mosquito colony: in the resistant colony, all bacteria increased survival by about twofold, while in the sensitive colony, only two of the four strains increased survival. The benefit concerning insecticide resistance came with little to no impact on the other traits (i.e., larval mortality, developmental time and adult longevity). Altogether, our results highlight the importance of considering environmental microbial exposure and mosquito microbial communities in epidemiological and vector-control studies, while also suggesting a possible role for Pseudomonas spp. as a symbiont in A. gambiae.",Animals; Anopheles; Pseudomonas; Insecticide Resistance; Larva; Insecticides; Permethrin; Female

This study investigated 52 chicken flocks, including commercial broilers, layers, and baladi, from various Egyptian governorates in 2023. These flocks exhibited symptoms of depression, along with kidney and bursa lesions, indicative of IBDV infection. Pooled Bursal homogenates were tested using RT-PCR with VP2-specific primers, revealing that 20 flocks tested positive for IBDV. Six representative samples were selected from 20 positive flocks for isolation in embryonated chicken eggs. The embryonic lesions observed included haemorrhage, skull swelling, and liver necrosis with a pale-yellow appearance, in addition to congestion and thickening in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Partial amplification of the VP2 gene from the harvested embryo suspensions of the six IBDV isolates was performed for sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed that five IBDV isolates (VV4, VV5, VV6, VV10, and VV16) belonged to the very virulent strain group A3 cluster, whereas one isolate (VV2) clustered with Chinese Variant strains in the A2d group. Sequence analysis of the hypervariable region (HVR) of VP2 compared to that of Egypt-USC-IBD-1-2019 and vvIBDV/Beh21/Egypt/18 highly virulent IBDV strains revealed several amino acid mutations. The VP2 HVR of all isolates maintained the serine-rich heptapeptide sequence SWSASGS, which is adjacent to the major hydrophilic peak B and serves as a virulence marker. Histopathological examination revealed that bursae from chickens infected with vvIBDV exhibited marked interlobular oedema and lymphoid depletion. In contrast, bursae from chickens infected with Variant IBDV showed massive lymphoid depletion, with hyperplasia of the bursal capsule. These findings highlight the circulation of both virulent and Variant IBDV strains in Egyptian chicken flocks, complicating disease control. Consequently, there is a need to update vaccination programs and vaccine strains for IBDV in Egypt.",Animals; Infectious bursal disease virus; Chickens; Egypt; Poultry Diseases; Birnaviridae Infections; Phylogeny; Chick Embryo; Bursa of Fabricius

This study aims to explore the anticancer roles of the fecal microbiota in inhibiting the progression of colorectal cancer and possible mechanisms. The intestinal microbial dysbiosis in CRC mice was significantly ameliorated by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), as indicated by the restored ACE index and Shannon index. The diameter and number of cancerous foci were significantly decreased in CRC mice treated with FMT, along with the restoration of the intestinal mucosal structure and the lessening of the gland arrangement disorder. Key factors in oxidative stress (TXN1, TXNRD1, and HIF-1α); cell cycle regulators (IGF-1, BIRC5, CDK8, HDAC2, EGFR, and CTSL); and a critical transcription factor of the innate immune signal pathway (IRF5) were among the repressed oncogenic targets engaged in the FMT treatment of CRC.

We evaluated the comprehensive effects of FMT using diarrheal or normal feces, as well as probiotic therapies, on multiple anatomical sites in healthy cynomolgus macaques through colonoscopy and surgery. Our research revealed that FMT led to a partial microbiome transplantation without exhibiting the donor's fecal clinical characteristics. Notably, FMT increased insulin and C-peptide levels in each animal according time series, regardless of fecal conditions. Immunologically, a reduction in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were exclusively observed in femoral veins of FMT group. In blood chemistry analyses, reductions in aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were observed in the femoral veins, while elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and calcium were exclusively detected in the portal veins. These changes were not observed in the probiotic group. Also, short chain fatty acids were significantly higher increase in portal veins rather than femoral veins. Transcriptome analysis of liver tissues showed that metabolic pathways were primarily affected by both FMT and probiotics therapies. In summary, FMT therapy significantly influenced metabolic, immunologic and transcriptomic responses in normal macaque models, regardless of fecal conditions. Also, these macaque models, which utilize surgery and colonoscopy, serve as a human-like preclinical platform for evaluating long-term effects and anatomically specific responses to gut-targeted interventions, without the need for animal sacrifice.",

Therefore, understanding how environmental aspects, including biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic factors, influence the movements of wild animals is an important focus of wildlife research and conservation. We apply Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze movement networks of a bull shark population in a network of acoustic receivers and identify the effects of environmental, social, or other types of covariates on their movements. We found that intra- and interspecific factors often had stronger effects on movements than environmental variables.

39619846,sunflower,4232,,,Meta-analysis unravels common responses of seed oil fatty acids to temperature for a wide set of genotypes of different plant species.,"Temperature is the main environmental determinant of seed oil fatty acid Q9 composition. There are no models describing common responses of main seed oil fatty acids to temperature in plants. The aim of thus work was to investigate common responses of seed oil fatty acids to minimum temperature during grain filling across species and genotypes. A database consisted of 164 genotypes of 9 species, sunflower, rapeseed, soybean, maize, flax, chia, safflower, olive and camelia, grown under a wide range of environmental conditions, was created and analyzed applying meta phenomics tools. Four widely sown species of the database was used to develop several common seed fatty acid responses and validate some models, and the other species were used to validate the General Model. The minimum temperature during grain filling responses of fatty acids in the General Model were close to responses found in genotypes of five independent species used to validate the model. Dissections of the general model by selecting the appropriate data allowed unraveling previously unknown features of the response of fatty acid to the minimum temperature during grain filling. The response of fatty acids to temperature for any species was unaffected by experimental conditions (field or controlled conditions) during the oil synthesis stage. The oleic acid trait did not affect the response to temperature of fatty acids synthesized downstream and upstream of it. Traits such as high stearic or high linoleic did not affect the response of fatty acids synthesized upstream or downstream of the trait. The established models and new knowledge could be applied to design cost effective and timely experiments to assess the potential responses of seed oil fatty acids to temperature of previously untested genotypes.",

Because of an economic issue and information gap, developing countries' survival depends on foods rich in carbohydrates but deficient in protein and micronutrients. However, it is paramount to mix ingredients that complement different nutritional profiles to alleviate the problem of malnutrition. Hence, in this research, maize, orange-fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine, and moringa leaf powder composites were used to develop nutritious instant porridge flour through extrusion cooking.

This study focuses on evaluating seven Sauerkraut-derived RAMULAB strains isolated from sauerkraut, aiming to identify promising candidates for modulating α-glucosidase (AG) and α-amylase (AM) enzymatic functions. RAMULAB strains with remarkable probiotic potential can contribute to the digestive health and manage conditions like diabetes. Identifying robust candidates from sauerkraut, a fermented food, holds promise for natural and cost-effective probiotic sources. The RAMULAB strains underwent extensive characterization, including identification through 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing. Their tolerance to harsh conditions, adherence properties, antimicrobial activity, antioxidant potential, and inhibition of AG and AM were assessed. In silico analyses explored their molecular interactions, particularly with hydroxycitric acid, a potential antidiabetic compound. Among the RAMULAB strains, RAMULAB48 emerged as a standout candidate. It displayed exceptional resilience to acidic bile (≥97%), and simulated gastrointestinal conditions (≥95%), highlighting its suitability for probiotic applications. RAMULAB48 exhibited robust adherence properties, including cell-surface hydrophobicity (80%), autoaggregation (42%), coaggregation with pathogens (≥33%), and adhesion to epithelial cells. Additionally, all seven isolates demonstrated gamma-hemolysis and resistance to antibiotics (Kanamycin, Methicillin, and Vancomycin), while displaying strong antibacterial properties against foodborne pathogens. These RAMULAB strains also exhibited varying degrees of antioxidant activity, with RAMULAB48 displaying the highest potential (≥41%). In terms of antidiabetic activity, cell-free supernatant (CS) obtained from RAMULAB48 expressed the highest inhibition levels, notably inhibiting yeast AG by an impressive 59.55% and AM being by a remarkable 67.42%. RAMULAB48 produced organic acids, including hydroxycitric acid (28.024 mg/mL), which showed promising antidiabetic properties through in silico analyses, indicating favorable interactions with the target enzymes.

This study comparatively investigated the effects of boiling and roasting on nutritional components contents, taste, and aroma to reveal the advantages of roasting in terms of the nutrition and flavor of peanuts. Results showed that boiling increased fat content to 54.47% of peanuts, diluted or reduced sugar content to an undetectable level, noticeably changed the contents of poly/monounsaturated fatty acids, and significantly decreased the content of free amino acid (FAA, 1.05 mg/g peanuts) in peanuts. Roasting simply decreased the contents of sugar and FAA to 2.78 and 1.82 mg/g peanuts, respectively. Compared with roasting, boiling had more discernible effects on fatty acids and FAAs. Both BPs and OPs have good dietary lipid quality. In terms of flavor, OPs had more FAAs (2 types) that contributed remarkably to the taste of peanuts than BPs (0 types), more volatile substances (40 types) than BPs (12 types), and a higher number of key volatile aroma components (8 types) than BPs (3 types). That is, roasting induced a relatively small effect on nutritional components and gave peanuts a richer taste and stronger aroma than boiling; therefore, roasting is an ideal peanut processing method. This study proved the different changes in peanuts caused by boiling and roasting on a material basis and corroborated the irreplaceability of roasting in peanut processing.",

We investigated the relationship between planting date of maize and FAW infestation in South Kivu, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in two sampling seasons (September to October 2020 and February to March 2021). Five planting dates were considered for 45 fields in each season. The incidence, severity of attack and larval density of FAW were assessed at the 8-leaf stage (V8) of maize development in monoculture and intercropping systems. Planting period, classified as late or early, had a strong influence on FAW larval density, incidence and severity. The results showed that the late planting period (mainly on 30 October in season-1 and 30 March in season-2) had the highest larval density, incidence and severity of attack compared to the early planting period (15 September in season-1 and 01 Mars in season-2). During the season-1, five larval stages were found in the same field, whereas all larval stages were present in season-2, regardless of planting period. High densities of L4, L5 and L6 larvae were much more associated with late planting and incidence appeared to be highest when these larvae were present. The presence of L2 and L3 larval stages was observed in maize cropping systems intercropped with soybean and peanuts, while maize in monoculture and intercropped with cassava and beans was colonized by L4, L5 and L6 larvae. This study highlights the existence of different maize planting dates in South Kivu and demonstrates that late plantings have significant FAW infestations compared to early plantings. It provides a basis for developing climate-smart integrated pest management.","Animals; Spodoptera; Zea mays; Larva; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Seasons; Crops, Agricultural; Agriculture; Farmers"

Herein we attempt to display the usefulness of the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome Oxidase I-coI in classical and barcode-based approaches for Leishmania characterization. A total of 228 samples were analyzed, comprising 28 Leishmania related taxa, mainly from cultures of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation`s Leishmania Collection. Primers were designed for amplification of coI; sequences were analyzed by distance-based indicators and both the Neighbor Joining and NeighborNet as species grouping techniques. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery was applied to define species delimitation while for the character-based analysis a software for Barcoding with Logic formulas was employed. Final sequences of 486 bp with 238 parsimonious sites were aligned and edited. Robust groups were formed for most of the genus species, distinctive nucleotide positions in the barcode sequence were observed for 11 of them. A good agreement between the techniques applied and the original characterization was observed. Few species were not distinguished by coI: (i) L. (V.) peruviana, L. (V.) lindenbergi, and L. (V.) utingensis; (ii) L. (L.) venezuelensis and (iii) L. colombiensis and L. equatorensis with identical sequences. Some of these taxa have been, at one time or another, classified as controversial and, for most of them, a higher number of isolates should be studied to properly infer their taxonomic status. CoI represents a mitochondrial target that stands out as a taxonomically important asset with multiple advantages over other genes. This paper corresponds to the first report of coI analysis in Leishmania, a potentially advantageous target for the characterization of this parasite.","Electron Transport Complex IV; Leishmania; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Phylogeny; Species Specificity"

Advances in bioinformatics now permit the reconstruction of almost intact microbial genomes, called metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), from metagenomic sequence data, allowing for more precise cell-level taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional profiling of uncultured extremophiles. Here, we report on the recovery and characterisation of metagenome-assembled genomes from the Buhera soda pans located in eastern Zimbabwe. This ecosystem has not been studied despite its unique geochemistry and potential as a habitat for unique microorganisms. Metagenomic DNA from the soda pan was sequenced using the DNA Nanoball Sequencing (DNBSEQR) technique. Sequence analysis, done on the Knowledgebase (KBase) platform, involved quality assessment, read assembly, contig binning, and MAG extraction. The MAGs were subjected to taxonomic placement, phylogenetic profiling and functional annotation in order to establish their possible ecological roles in the soda pan ecosystem. A total of 16 bacterial MAGs of medium to high quality were recovered, all distributed among five phyla dominated by Pseudomonadota and Bacillota. Of the ten MAGs that were taxonomically classified up to genus level, five of them belonged to the halophilic/ haloalkaliphilic genera Alkalibacterium, Vibrio, Thioalkalivibrio, Cecembia and Nitrincola, underscoring the importance of haloalkaliphiles in the Buhera soda pans. Functional profiling revealed the possession of diverse carbohydrate-metabolising pathways by the MAGs, with glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathways appearing to be key pathways in this ecosystem. Several MAGs possessed pathways that implicated them in some key aspects of the nitrogen and sulphur cycle. Some MAGs harboured both sulphate reduction and respiratory pathways, suggesting a possible mechanism of ATP biosynthesis through sulphate respiration. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the recovery and taxonomic and functional annotation of high quality microbial genomes from extreme environments, making it possible to establish the ecological roles and biotechnological potential of uncultured microorganisms.","Zimbabwe; Metagenome; Phylogeny; Metagenomics; Bacteria; Genome, Bacterial; Ecosystem; Microbiota; Extreme Environments"

This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of Mesua ferrea Linn., a medicinal plant, as a source for novel antimalarial compounds. In this study, we conducted in vitro assays to evaluate the antimalarial activity and cytotoxicity of crude extracts derived from M. ferrea L. leaves and branches. Subsequently, the most promising extracts were subjected to assessments of their antimalarial efficacy and acute oral toxicity tests in mouse models. Furthermore, selected crude extracts underwent gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to identify their phytochemical compositions. Our findings revealed that the ethanolic extract of M. ferrea L. branches (EMFB) exhibited high antimalarial activity, with an IC50 value of 4.54 μg/mL, closely followed by the ethanolic extract of M. ferrea L. leaves (EMFL), with an IC50 value of 6.76 μg/mL. Conversely, the aqueous extracts of M. ferrea L. branches (AMFB) and leaves (AMFL) exhibited weak and inactive activity, respectively. The selected extracts, EMFB and EMFL, demonstrated significant dose-dependent parasitemia suppression, reaching a maximum of 62.61% and 54.48% at 600 mg/kg body weight, respectively. Furthermore, the acute oral toxicity test indicated no observable toxicity at a dosage of 2,000 mg/kg body weight for both extracts.

The pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of ovine babesiosis are well-known, but there is a lack of information regarding caprine babesiosis. Since the discovery of the first Babesia spp. in 1888, several species/subspecies/genotypes, including Babesia aktasi, have been described. Our recent molecular survey revealed that the parasite is highly prevalent (22.5%) in indigenous goats from Mediterranean region of Türkiye. The aim of this experimental study was to determine the pathogenicity and virulence of B. aktasi in immunosuppressed (n = 5) and immunocompetent (n = 7) purebred Saanen goats. The goats were experimentally infected with fresh B. aktasi infected blood, and examined for clinical, parasitological, hematological, and serum biochemical findings throughout the infection. Following the parasite inoculation, intra-erythrocytic parasites were detected from the 1st day post-infection, followed by an increase in rectal temperature and parasitemia. The parasitemia was detected ranging from 4.3% to 33.5% in the immunosuppressed group, while it was 2.1% to 7.6% in the immunocompetent. Severe clinical symptoms characterized by anemia, jaundice, and hemoglobinuria developed in both groups. A statistically significant inverse correlation was observed between the increase in parasitemia and RBC, WBC, HCT, and Hb values in the goats compared to pre-infection levels. Values of AST, ALT, GGT, Total bilirubin, and Albumin showed a significant increase, with all the immunosuppressed goats dying on the 4th and 7th days post-infection, while four out of seven immunocompetent goats died on between 6-8th days. Severe edema in the lungs, frothy fluid in the trachea, jaundice in the subcutaneous and mesenteric fat, and dark red urine were detected in necropsy. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that B. aktasi was highly pathogenic to purebred Saanen goats.

39622651,N. fowleri,5763,,,Understanding the pathogenicity of Naegleria fowleri in association with N. fowleri antigen-1 (Nfa1).,"Naegleria fowleri, a brain-eating amoeba, thrives in lakes and rivers with aquatic vegetation and causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) in humans. Most recently, it has become such a serious problem that N. fowleri was detected in tap water in Houston, USA. Several pathogenic factors are considered very important to destroy target cells in the brain. In particular, the food-cup where N. fowleri antigen-1 (Nfa1) is located, is strongly expressed in pseudopodia involved in the movement of N. fowleri, and is involved in phagocytosis by attaching to target cells. In this article, we reviewed the role of the Nfa1 protein and its associated pathogenicity. The nfa1 gene was cloned by cDNA library immunoscreening using infection serum and immune serum. Nfa1 protein is mainly distributed in pseudopodia important to movement and vacuoles. Moreover, heat shock protein 70, cathepsin-like proteare and Nf-actin are also associated with pseudopodia in which Nfa1 is localized. Interestingly, the amount of the nfa1 gene changed as N. fowleri trophozoites transformed into cysts. Polyclonal antiserum against Nfa1 showed a protective effect against cytotoxicity of approximately 19.7%. Nfa1-specific IgA antibodies prevent N. fowleri trophozoites from adhering to the nasal mucosa, delaying invasion. The nfa1-vaccinated mice showed significantly higher levels of Nfa1-specific antibody. The duration of anti-Nfa1 IgG in the vaccinated mice lasted 12 weeks, strongly suggesting that nfa1 is a significant pathogenic gene and that Nfa1 is a pathogenic protein. Several factors related to pseudopodia and locomotion have been linked to Nfa1. A clearer function of N. fowleri targeting nfa1 with other genes might enable target-based inhibition of N. fowleri pathogenicity.","Naegleria fowleri; Animals; Antigens, Protozoan; Central Nervous System Protozoal Infections; Humans; Protozoan Proteins; Mice; Amebiasis"
39622653,Toxoplasma gondii,5811,,,Probiotic-induced changes in intestinal microbiome inhibits Toxoplasma gondii infection.,"Toxoplasma gondii primarily invades the central nervous system, causing latent infections. Cysts persist in the host for life and there is currently no effective treatment. T. gondii infects human hosts through contaminated meat, invading the intestinal tissue and leading to changes in the number and composition of the gut microbiota. Since probiotic ingestion modulates intestinal microbiota changes, we hypothesized that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis caused by T. gondii infection would be restored following probiotic supplementation. To this end, we orally infected C57BL/6 mice with 10 T. gondii cysts and administered supplemental probiotics daily. We analyzed the levels of T. gondii B1 gene DNA, indicative of T. gondii infection, in brain tissue. We investigated alterations in the gut microbiota composition and functional pathways between the probiotic and non-probiotic treatment groups via next-generation sequencing analysis of each fecal sample. The infection level in the probiotic-treated group was significantly reduced after 4 weeks (p&lt;0.05). Probiotic supplementation notably changed the gut microbiota after 2 weeks of infection, increasing the relative abundance of Intestinimonas massiliensis and Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus. Probiotic supplements appear to modulate the gut microbiota, activating functional pathways involved in intestinal short-chain fatty acid production and strengthening the intestinal barrier, thereby impeding T. gondii infection and subsequent proliferation. Our findings provide valuable insights into T. gondii infection control and future study directions.","Animals; Probiotics; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice; Toxoplasma; Dysbiosis; Feces; Toxoplasmosis; Brain; Toxoplasmosis, Animal; Female; Disease Models, Animal"
39622656,trematodes,1290878,,,Functional characterization of glucose transporter 4 involved in glucose uptake in Clonorchis sinensis.,"Clonorchis sinensis, which causes clonorchiasis, is prevalent in East Asian countries and poses notable health risks, including bile duct complications. Although praziquantel is the primary treatment for the disease, the emerging resistance among trematodes highlights the need for alternative strategies. Understanding the nutrient uptake mechanisms in trematodes, including C. sinensis, is crucial for developing future effective treatments. This study aimed to characterize the function of C. sinensis glucose transporter 4 (CsGTP4) and determine its role in nutrient uptake employing synthesized cDNA of adult C. sinensis worms. The functional characterization of CsGTP4 involved injecting its cRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes and analyzing the deoxy-D-glucose uptake levels. The results demonstrated that deoxy-D-glucose uptake depended on the deoxy-D-glucose incubation and CsGTP4 expression time, but not sodium-dependent. The concentration-dependent uptake followed the Michaelis-Menten equation, with a Km value of 2.7 mM and a Vmax value of 476 pmol/oocyte/h based on the Lineweaver-Burk analysis. No uptake of radiolabeled α-ketoglutarate, p-aminohippurate, taurocholate, arginine, or carnitine was observed. The uptake of deoxy-D-glucose by CsGTP4 was significantly inhibited by unlabeled glucose and galactose in a concentration-dependent manner. It was significantly inhibited under strongly acidic and basic conditions. These insights into the glucose uptake kinetics and pH dependency of CsGTP4 provide a deeper understanding of nutrient acquisition in trematodes. This study contributes to the development of novel antiparasitic agents, addressing a considerable socioeconomic challenge in affected regions.",Animals; Clonorchis sinensis; Glucose; Xenopus laevis; Glucose Transporter Type 4; Oocytes; Biological Transport; Clonorchiasis

The snails were collected from 35 sites during 2 cycles of the wet (July-October) and dry (November-June) seasons in 2018-2019. A total of 29,420 snails representing 24 species/subspecies were examined for cercarial infection using shedding and crushing techniques. We found that 1,275 snails from 12 species/subspecies were infected, resulting in an overall prevalence of 4.3%. Infections were significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) during the wet season (5.9%; 970/16,473) than during the dry season (2.4%; 305/12,947). Morphological identification revealed 37 distinct types within 15 morphotypes, with the armatae morphotype showing the highest infection rate (1.8%) and the greatest cercarial diversity (8 distinct types). This study highlights the health risk posed by the Bithynia siamensis siamensis, which was the second most prevalent (8.5%) and hosted the greatest cercarial diversity (11 morphotypes, 15 distinct types). This subspecies also displayed a wide distribution range (31 localities) with a generally high occurrence frequency in the BMR. This study firstly documents a gymnophallid digenean as a freshwater digenean, presenting evidence of a dichotoma cercarial morphotype from 4 species/subspecies (Filopaludina martensi martensi, F. sumatrensis polygramma, B. siamensis siamensis, and Wattebledia siamensis) with a low infection range (0.1-0.4%). A staggering diversity of cercariae was observed in the BMR canal networks with seasonal fluctuations. The B. siamensis siamensis displayed notable epidemiological importance in the BMR flowing-water networks.

39622781,Staphylococcus aureus,1280,,,Lipoteichoic Acid Rescued Age-Related Bone Loss by Enhancing Neuroendocrine and Growth Hormone Secretion Through TLR2/COX2/PGE2 Signalling Pathway.,"The phenomenon of brain-bone crosstalk pertains to the intricate interaction and communication pathways between the central nervous system and the skeletal system. Disruption in brain-bone crosstalk, particularly in disorders such as osteoporosis, can result in skeletal irregularities. Consequently, investigating and comprehending this communication network holds paramount importance in the realm of bone disease prevention and management. In this study, we found that Staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid promoted the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE2 by interacting with TLR2 receptors acting on the surface of microglial cells in the pituitary gland, leading to the upregulation of COX-2 expression. Subsequently, PGE2 bound to the EP4 receptor of growth hormone-secreting cells and activated the intracellular CREB signalling pathway, promoting GH secretion and ameliorating age-related bone loss.","Lipopolysaccharides; Teichoic Acids; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Signal Transduction; Animals; Dinoprostone; Cyclooxygenase 2; Growth Hormone; Osteoporosis; Aging; Mice; Microglia; Staphylococcus aureus; Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP4 Subtype; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Neurosecretory Systems; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Male"

However, data on their specific identity and prevalence remain limited. This study aims to identify louse fly samples from captive cervids at Khon Kaen Zoo using morphological and molecular analyses. A total of 60 louse flies were collected from 17 captive cervids and identified based on their morphology. Major morphological characteristics, including mesothoracic bristle patterns, abdominal tergal plate bristles, and terminalia structure indicated that the Khon Kaen louse fly is Lipoptena axis Maa, 1965. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences from a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was performed, which confirmed that L. axis of this study belongs to the cervi group, which is distinct from other groups of Lipoptena species.

39623089,F. oxysporum,5507,,,Synergistic growth suppression of Fusarium oxysporum MLY127 through Dimethachlon Nanoencapsulation and co-application with Bacillus velezensis MLY71.,"Fusarium oxysporum is a destructive plant pathogen with robust survival mechanisms, complicating control efforts. This study aimed to develop nanoformulated fungicides, screen antagonistic bacteria, and evaluate their combined efficacy. A novel self-emulsifying nanoemulsion (DZW) was formulated using zein and benzaldehyde-modified wheat gluten (BgWG) as carriers for dimethachlon (DTN). The preparation process optimized material ratios and emulsification techniques. Concurrently, antagonistic bacterial strains against F. oxysporum were screened via the plate standoff method, identifying Bacillus velezensis MLY71 as both antagonistic and compatible with DTN. The DZW nanoemulsion achieved a particle size of 93.22 nm, an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 90.57%, and a DTN loading capacity (LC) of 67.09%, with sustained release over 96 h. The combination of DTN (0.04 mg·mL⁻¹) and B. velezensis MLY71 (1 × 10⁴ CFU·mL⁻¹) achieved a 76.66% inhibition rate against F. oxysporum MLY127, 1.71 times greater than DTN alone, indicating significant synergy. At a DTN concentration of 0.20 mg·mL⁻¹, the combination of DZW and MLY71 showed a synergy coefficient of 1.33. This synergy was also observed in soil environments, indicating its adaptability for controlling soil-borne pathogens. As sustainable management continues to gain attention in agricultural disease control, this study offers a promising strategy for achieving higher efficacy with the same fungicide dose or satisfactory control with reduced fungicide application. The excellent drug-loading performance of BgWG also expanded the applications of the wheat by-product gluten.","Fusarium; Bacillus; Fungicides, Industrial; Plant Diseases; Triticum; Particle Size"

39624001,S. mutans,1309,,,Decoding Adenine DNA Methylation Effects in Streptococcus Mutans: Insights Into Self-DNA Protection and Autoaggregation.,"Streptococcus mutans, a key player in dental caries, faces multiple environmental challenges within the oral cavity, including oxidative stress, nutrient scarcity, and acidic pH. To survive and thrive, S. mutans has evolved intricate mechanisms, including the CSP-ComDE quorum sensing system, which coordinates responses to environmental cues. The CSP-ComDE system enables S. mutans to communicate with neighboring cells via its CSP pheromone. Under stress conditions, the CSP pheromone production increases, triggering a cascade of events. Notably, our research demonstrated that the CSP pheromone activates the expression of a Type II restriction-modification (R-M) system. Type II R-M systems are well-known tools in molecular biology and genetic engineering and consist of two distinct enzymes: a restriction enzyme and a methyltransferase. An increasing number of studies have revealed that bacterial adenine methylation (Dam methylation) has a broader role beyond mere DNA protection. In fact, the marks introduced into the DNA provide signals for a variety of physiological processes. Our results highlight a conserved chromosomal locus in S. mutans encoding the DpnII R-M system. DpnII R-M methylates DNA at 5'-GATC target sites within the S. mutans genome and cleaves unmarked DNA. Furthermore, our findings suggest that Dam methylation significantly impacts foreign DNA acquisition via natural transformation and modulates mutanobactin expression-a secondary metabolite linked to oxidative stress tolerance. Collectively, our findings suggest that Dam methylation bridges epigenetics and bacterial fitness, potentially opening new avenues in bacterial epigenetics. As we explore this intricate biological process, we may uncover novel therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial infections.","Streptococcus mutans; DNA Methylation; Quorum Sensing; Bacterial Proteins; Adenine; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; DNA, Bacterial; Dental Caries; Pheromones; Oxidative Stress"

They have the ability to produce various types of biofuels, such as ethanol, hydrogen, and biodiesel. This study is a systematic review of scientific articles published between 2011 and 2022, focusing on the optimization of cyanobacteria cultivation for biofuel production. The results indicated that the most favorable temperature for the cultivation of cyanobacteria is around 30-40 °C. In addition, there is a relationship between temperature, light, and nutrients to increase the production of lipids of interest for biofuel production. With the advancement of technological tools, researchers can genetically manipulate these bacteria to increase the production of desired molecules, such as lipids or alcohol, by introducing genes that encode enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these molecules. Once the cyanobacteria have been modified to produce the desired molecules, they can be cultivated in large-scale bioreactors and harvested for further processing. However, despite the great potential of cyanobacteria-based biofuel production, there are still challenges to be overcome. These include improving the efficiency and scalability of the production process, optimizing the composition of the produced biofuels, and reducing production costs. With continuous research and development, biofuels produced using cyanobacteria can play a significant role in meeting a substantial portion of the high energy demand.",

Therefore, drugs that reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation may be helpful in depression as monotherapy or as an adjunct to conventional antidepressants. Zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, has been identified as a putative antidepressant in an in vitro study. It was shown to modulate the proinflammatory macrophage response in the brain and, hence, neuroinflammation. Currently, there are no antidepressants that target the inflammatory component of depression.

The influence of these amendments on other members of the agroecosystem, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), remains less well investigated. Here, we established an experiment with the application of woody peat organic fertilizer and phosphate rock powder to examine its effects on AMF communities in two cadmium-contaminated vegetable crop fields (cucumber and pepper). We found that the application of phosphate rock powder enhanced soil phosphorus content, while the application of woody peat organic fertilizer enhanced soil nitrogen content, but neither influenced AMF abundance. We also found little influence of either amendment on measures of AMF diversity, except in one case where the Shannon index of diversity was lower in pepper fields amended with phosphate rock powder. We did, however, find significant shifts in the community composition and relative abundances of AMF taxa in the two vegetable fields, primarily as a result of shifts in the soil pH and nitrogen content.",

39625561,cats,9685,,,Feature selectivity and invariance in marsupial primary visual cortex.,"A fundamental question in sensory neuroscience revolves around how neurons represent complex visual stimuli. In mammalian primary visual cortex (V1), neurons decode intricate visual features to identify objects, with most being selective for edge orientation, but with half of those also developing invariance to edge position within their receptive fields. Position invariance allows cells to continue to code an edge even when it moves around. Combining feature selectivity and invariance is integral to successful object recognition. Considering the marsupial-eutherian divergence 160 million years ago, we explored whether feature selectivity and invariance was similar in marsupials and eutherians. We recovered the spatial filters and non-linear processing characteristics of the receptive fields of neurons in wallaby V1 and compared them with previous results from cat cortex. We stimulated the neurons in V1 with white Gaussian noise and analysed responses using the non-linear input model. Wallabies exhibit the same high percentage of orientation selective neurons as cats. However, in wallabies we observed a notably higher prevalence of neurons with three or more filters compared to cats. We show that having three or more filters substantially increases phase invariance in the V1s of both species, but that wallaby V1 accentuates this feature, suggesting that the species condenses more processing into the earliest cortical stage. These findings suggest that evolution has led to more than one solution to the problem of creating complex visual processing strategies. KEY POINTS: Previous studies have shown that the primary visual cortex (V1) in mammals is essential for processing complex visual stimuli, with neurons displaying selectivity for edge orientation and position. This research explores whether the visual processing mechanisms in marsupials, such as wallabies, are similar to those in eutherian mammals (e.g. cats). The study found that wallabies have a higher prevalence of neurons with multiple spatial filters in V1, indicating more complex visual processing. Using a non-linear input model, we demonstrated that neurons with three or more filters increase phase invariance. These findings suggest that marsupials and eutherian mammals have evolved similar strategies for visual processing, but marsupials have condensed more capacity to build phase invariance into the first step in the cortical pathway.",Animals; Primary Visual Cortex; Cats; Neurons; Macropodidae; Marsupialia; Male; Visual Cortex; Photic Stimulation
39625663,Bt,1428,,,"Bacillus thuringiensis Cry5, Cry21, App6 and Xpp55 proteins to control Meloidogyne javanica and M. incognita.","The global imperative to enhance crop protection while preserving the environment has increased interest in the application of biological pesticides. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a Gram-positive bacterium that can produce nematicidal proteins and accumulate them in parasporal crystals. Root-knot nematodes are obligate root plant parasitic which are distributed worldwide, causing severe damages to the infested plants and, consequently, large yield reductions. In this work, we have evaluated the toxicity of the Bt crystal proteins Cry5, Cry21, App6, and Xpp55 against two root-knot nematodes belonging to the Meloidogyne genus (M. incognita and M. javanica). The results show that all four proteins, when solubilized, were highly toxic for both nematode species. To check the potential of using Bt strains producing nematicidal crystal proteins as biopesticides to control root-knot nematodes in the field, in planta assays were conducted, using two wild Bt strains which produced Cry5 or a combination of App6 and Cry5 proteins. The tests were carried out with cucumber or with tomato plants infested with M. javanica J2, irrigated with spore + cristal mixtures of the respective strains. The results showed that the effectiveness of the nematicidal activity was plant-dependent, as Bt was able to reduce emerged J2 in tomato plants but not in cucumber plants. In addition, the toxicity observed in the in planta assays was much lower than expected, highlighting the difficulty of the proteins supplied as crystals to exert their toxicity. This emphasizes the delivery of the Bt proteins as crucial for its use to control root-knot nematodes. KEY POINTS: • Solubilized Cry5, Cry21, App6 and Xpp55 Bt proteins are toxic to M. javanica. • Cry21 toxicity to M. incognita is similar to that of Cry5, App6, and Xpp55 proteins. • The Cry5 and App6 toxicities on M. javanica after Bt irrigation is crop dependent.","Animals; Tylenchoidea; Bacterial Proteins; Hemolysin Proteins; Bacillus thuringiensis Toxins; Endotoxins; Solanum lycopersicum; Bacillus thuringiensis; Pest Control, Biological; Plant Diseases; Cucumis sativus; Antinematodal Agents; Plant Roots"

39625876,fungi,4751,,,Environmental fungi target thiol homeostasis to compete with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"Mycobacterial species in nature are found in abundance in sphagnum peat bogs where they compete for nutrients with a variety of microorganisms including fungi. We screened a collection of fungi isolated from sphagnum bogs by co-culture with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to look for inducible expression of antitubercular agents and identified 5 fungi that produced cidal antitubercular agents upon exposure to live Mtb. Whole genome sequencing of these fungi followed by fungal RNAseq after Mtb exposure allowed us to identify biosynthetic gene clusters induced by co-culture. Three of these fungi induced expression of patulin, one induced citrinin expression and one induced the production of nidulalin A. The biosynthetic gene clusters for patulin and citrinin have been previously described but the genes involved in nidulalin A production have not been described before. All 3 of these potent electrophiles react with thiols and treatment of Mtb cells with these agents followed by Mtb RNAseq showed that these natural products all induce profound thiol stress suggesting a rapid depletion of mycothiol. The induction of thiol-reactive mycotoxins through 3 different systems in response to exposure to Mtb suggests that fungi have identified this as a highly vulnerable target in a similar microenvironment to that of the caseous human lesion.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Homeostasis; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Antitubercular Agents; Fungi; Multigene Family; Citrinin; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Mycotoxins; Coculture Techniques"
39625917,Staphylococcus aureus,1280,,,Free DNA partially clarifies discrepancies between qPCR and the conventional phage quantification method.,"To use phages in a personalized therapy and industrial applications, an accurate quantification is needed. The gold standard method, namely the culture-based double agar overlay (DAO) method, provides an accurate estimate of the number of infectious phages but is laborious and time-intensive. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) can be used as a fast alternative but tends to overestimate the number of infectious phage particles. Here we describe the use of a DNase treatment before quantification of the Staphylococcus aureus phage ISP with qPCR to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of infectious phage particles. We showed that DNase treatment results in a significant decrease of the concentration when measured with qPCR although for two out of three tested ISP phage stocks, there was still a significant difference with the DAO method. We also showed that the discrepancy between quantification with qPCR and the DAO method is dependent on the storage period of the phage stock, with a larger discrepancy for older stocks. Additionally, we used negative contrast immune electron microscopy to confirm the presence of DNA in the medium of the phage stock and the impact of the DNase treatment on the free DNA.","DNA, Viral; Staphylococcus aureus; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Bacteriophages; Deoxyribonucleases; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Staphylococcus Phages"
39625918,hazelnuts,13450,,,Characteristics of wild hazelnut populations in Northeast China and selection of superior provenances.,"China possesses a copious and geographically diverse reservoir of hazel (Corylus spp.) resources, albeit scholarly endeavors focusing on the selection and domestication of indigenous wild hazelnut strains remain scant. To develop and utilize high-quality wild hazelnut resources, this study selected eight populations of wild hazelnuts from seven different provenances in Heilongjiang Province, China. Natural hybrid seeds of eight populations were sown in the Chohai Forest Farm in Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, in 2018. In April 2020, two-year-old seedlings were used to establish a provenance trial forest, thereby initiating the provenance trial. Growth parameters were measured using electronic calipers, and pollen characteristics were observed under an electron microscope. The trials meticulously explored the trees' flowering biology, growth parameters, and the economic attributes of the produced nuts. Principal component analysis was employed to comprehensively assess differences among the wild hazelnut populations from various provenances, aiming to identify superior wild hazelnut provenances. The results unveiled significant geographical variations among the tested provenances across several facets: the flowering period of male blossoms extended from April 2nd to April 19th, while female flowering occurred within the timeframe of April 2nd to April 22nd. Moreover, pollen grain morphology demonstrated variability, with the polar axis ranging from 14.02 to 17.09 micrometers, the equatorial axis spanning 16.02 to 18.75 micrometers, and the ratio of polar to equatorial axes fluctuating between 0.88 and 0.92. Through correlation analyses, nut length emerged as a pivotal determinant significantly influencing both kernel weight and the hundred-grain weight. A principal component analysis (PCA) further consolidated these findings, selecting the Nehe-originated variegated Corylus heterophylla as the superior provenance based on a comprehensive evaluation of its combined traits. This study constitutes a seminal contribution to the hazelnut breeding endeavor in China, establishing a robust foundation for informed cultivation strategies geared towards optimizing both the yield and the quality of hazelnut resources, thereby advancing the understanding and exploitation of China's wild hazelnut biodiversity.",Corylus; China; Seeds; Pollen; Nuts; Flowers
39625973,bacteria,629395,,,Navigated range expansion promotes migratory culling.,"Motile organisms can expand into new territories and increase their fitness, while nonmotile viruses usually depend on host migration to spread across long distances. In general, faster host motility facilitates virus transmission. However, recent ecological studies have also shown that animal host migration can reduce viral prevalence by removing infected individuals from the migratory group. Here, we use a bacteria-bacteriophage copropagation system to investigate how host motility affects viral spread during range expansion. We find that phage spread during chemotaxis-driven navigated range expansion decreases as bacterial migration speed increases. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the navigated migration leads to a spatial sorting of infected and uninfected hosts in the copropagating front of bacteria-bacteriophage, with implications for the number of cells left behind.

39616384,hepatitis B virus,10407,,,Advanced siRNA delivery in combating hepatitis B virus: mechanistic insights and recent updates.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health problem, causing thousands of deaths each year worldwide. Although current medications can often inhibit viral replication and reduce the risk of liver carcinoma, several obstacles still hinder their effectiveness. These include viral resistance, prolonged treatment duration, and low efficacy in clearing viral antigens. To address these challenges in current HBV treatment, numerous approaches have been developed with remarkable success. Among these strategies, small-interfering RNA (siRNA) stands out as one of the most promising therapies for hepatitis B. However, naked siRNAs are vulnerable to enzymatic digestion, easily eliminated by renal filtration, and unable to cross the cell membrane due to their large, anionic structure. Therefore, effective delivery systems are required to protect siRNAs and maintain their functionality. In this review, we have discussed the promises of siRNA therapy in treating HBV, milestones in their delivery systems, and products that have entered clinical trials. Finally, we have outlined the future perspectives of siRNA-based therapy for HBV treatment.","RNA, Small Interfering; Humans; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B; Animals; Drug Delivery Systems; Virus Replication; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Therapy; Antiviral Agents"

It usually presents as a disease of the lower extremities, characterized by paralysis and sensory loss. HTLV-1 is common. However, only a small fraction of those infected actually experience clinical symptoms. Respiratory complications are rare; this case discusses an uncommon presentation of acute respiratory failure in a patient with TSP. A bedridden 73-year-old female with HTLV-1-associated TSP, presenting with progressive deterioration of motor and sensory functions in the lower limbs for 10 years, was admitted with sepsis due to recurrent urinary tract infection. On admission, she had hypotension with leukocytosis. She had initial stabilization but showed hypoxia and hypotension on day 5 with a chest X-ray showing total left lung collapse due to an obstructive mucous plug. She has been given hypertonic saline nebulizers and chest physiotherapy, following which there was a partial recovery; however, she then suffered a cardiac arrest that was followed by a tracheostomy for airway protection. In this case, the potential respiratory risk factors associated with TSP, such as failure to clear secretions properly, are underlined. Further research is needed with respect to respiratory muscle involvement in TSP patients and proactive airway management strategies. The tracheostomy intervention performed here only proves the need for addressing respiratory complications in this vulnerable population.",

39620402,cats,9685,,,Reporting and interpreting statistical results in veterinary medicine: Calling for change.,"Understanding and correctly interpreting statistical results presented in scientific articles is a required skill for practicing evidence-based veterinary medicine. A prerequisite for doing so is the adequate reporting of the results in scientific journals. However, most authors of veterinary publications determine the importance of their findings based on statistical significance (ie, P < .05), indicating that neither the limitations of using P values for inference nor the existence of more appropriate alternatives are widely appreciated in veterinary medicine. This deficiency in knowledge indicates a need to increase awareness in veterinary medicine regarding reporting statistical measures that quantify the magnitude of an effect along with its level of uncertainty, and then interpreting these results for clinical decision making. We utilize a hypothetical randomized controlled trial of dietary management in cats with chronic kidney disease to discuss some common misconceptions about P values and provide practical suggestions for alternatives. Reporting appropriate effect estimates along with their confidence intervals will allow veterinarians to easily and correctly determine whether the magnitude of the effect of interest meets clinical needs while acknowledging uncertainty in the results. We also describe confidence interval functions and show their utility as visual tools in aiding interpretation of confidence intervals. By providing practical guidance, we show that a change in reporting and interpreting statistical results is feasible and necessary. We hope this crucial step will promote clinical decision making based on effect estimates and confidence intervals.","Animals; Veterinary Medicine; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Cats; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Cat Diseases"
39620500,cyanobacteria,1117,Sec61,29927,Progress in the discovery and development of anticancer agents from marine cyanobacteria.,"Covering 2010-April 2024There have been tremendous new discoveries and developments since 2010 in anticancer research based on marine cyanobacteria. Marine cyanobacteria are prolific sources of anticancer natural products, including the tubulin agents dolastatins 10 and 15 which were originally isolated from a mollusk that feeds on cyanobacteria. Decades of research have culminated in the approval of six antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and many ongoing clinical trials. Antibody conjugation has been enabling for several natural products, particularly cyanobacterial cytotoxins. Targeting tubulin dynamics has been a major strategy, leading to the discovery of the gatorbulin scaffold, acting on a new pharmacological site. Cyanobacterial compounds with different mechanisms of action (MOA), targeting novel or validated targets in a range of organelles, also show promise as anticancer agents. Important advances include the development of compounds with novel MOA, including apratoxin and coibamide A analogues, modulating cotranslational translocation at the level of Sec61 in the endoplasmic reticulum, largazole and santacruzamate A targeting class I histone deacetylases, and proteasome inhibitors based on carmaphycins, resembling the approved drug carfilzomib. The pipeline extends with SERCA inhibitors, mitochondrial cytotoxins and membrane-targeting agents, which have not yet advanced clinically since the biology is less understood and selectivity concerns remain to be addressed. In addition, efforts have also focused on the identification of chemosensitizing and antimetastatic agents. The review covers the state of current knowledge of marine cyanobacteria as anticancer agents with a focus on the mechanism, target identification and potential for drug development. We highlight the importance of solving the supply problem through chemical synthesis as well as illuminating the biological activity and in-depth mechanistic studies to increase the value of cyanobacterial natural products to catalyze their development.",Cyanobacteria; Antineoplastic Agents; Humans; Biological Products; Drug Discovery; Aquatic Organisms; Molecular Structure; Animals; Depsipeptides

However, when engineered microbes operate in real-world environments, it remains unclear how competition with natural microbes affect their performance over long time periods. Here, we engineer sensors and memory-storing genetic circuits inside the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis to sense the TNT explosive and maintain a long-term response, using predictive models to design riboswitch sensors, tune transcription rates, and improve the genetic circuit's dynamic range. We characterize the autonomous microbial sensor's ability to detect TNT in a natural soil system, measuring single-cell and population-level behavior over a 28-day period. The autonomous microbial sensor activates its response by 14-fold when exposed to low TNT concentrations and maintains stable activation for over 21 days, exhibiting exponential decay dynamics at the population-level with a half-life of about 5 days. Overall, we show that autonomous microbial sensors can carry out long-term detection of an important chemical in natural soil with competitive growth dynamics serving as additional biocontainment.",Bacillus subtilis; Trinitrotoluene; Soil Microbiology; Biosensing Techniques; Soil Pollutants; Explosive Agents; Riboswitch; Soil; Gene Regulatory Networks

Herein, we combined PacBio HiFi data together with Hi-C mapping technology to construct a chromosome-scale reference genome assembly for Z. nitidum. The assembly reached a length of 2.24 Gb, successfully anchoring 99.31% of sequences onto 35 pseudo-chromosomes. Among these, 26 chromosomes achieved telomere-to-telomere assembly, and 11 chromosomes were gap-free. The contigs N50 and scaffolds N50 reached 57.61 Mb and 78.00 Mb, respectively. Transposable elements comprised 81.44% of the Z. nitidum genome, and over 78% of them were long-terminal repeat retrotransposon elements. Furthermore, 32,737 protein-coding genes were identified and 99.38% of all were functionally annotated. The completeness of the genome assembly and final gene sets reached 97.83% and 96.47% based on Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO), respectively. Taken together, our results provided a high-quality chromosome-level assembly of Z. nitidum genome and will be a valuable resource that will facilitate breeding varieties with higher alkaloids content.","Zanthoxylum; Genome, Plant; Chromosomes, Plant; Plants, Medicinal"
39622851,sunflower,4232,,,Spontaneous nanosized liposome formation from crude dried lecithin upon addition of glycerol.,"Nanosized liposomal vesicles (NLV) were successfully prepared using natural sunflower lecithin without the use of high-pressure homogenization or filtration. Upon glycerol addition to dispersions of lecithin multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), these broke down spontaneously to liposomes with diameters in the range of 100-200 nm. Static light scattering demonstrated that glycerol addition above 30% (w/w) induced the complete transformation of MLVs into NLVs. Langmuir trough compression experiments showed a two-region compressional behavior. Upon 62% (w/w) glycerol addition, the compressional modulus of the liposomes decreased from 18.5 to 8.13 mN/m. Water activity and pulse NMR measurements also showed a divergence in behavior above 30% (w/w) glycerol. Liposomes were not birefringent in water but became strongly birefringent at and above 30% (w/w) glycerol, as determined by polarized light microscopy, and lost all birefringence above 80% (w/w). This was interpreted as the induction of stress-birefringence in the phospholipid bilayers above 30% (w/w) glycerol, and a relaxation of such stress above 80% (w/w) glycerol. We hypothesize that the mixture of phospholipids in the lecithin results in an effective non-zero intrinsic curvature for the molecular mixture, which lowers the bending energy of the bilayer, allowing for an easier break-up upon mixing. Secondly, glycerol addition decreases attractive van der Waals' interaction between lamellae in an MLV, thus weakening the multilamellar liposome walls. Glycerol also affects bilayer stability by strengthening the hydrogen bond network of water, which will affect phospholipid headgroup hydration. All these factors result in the spontaneous breakdown of MLVs into NLVs.",Liposomes; Lecithins; Glycerol; Water; Nanoparticles; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

39622961,Amur tiger,74533,,,Genetic insights and conservation strategies for Amur tigers in Southwest Primorye Russia.,"Southwest Primorye hosts approximately 9% of the remaining wild Amur tiger population and represents hope for the revival of tigers in Northeast China and the Korean peninsula. Decades of conservation efforts have led to a significant increase in population size, from less than 10 individuals surviving in the region in 1996 to multiple folds today. However, while the population size has recovered since the mid-1900s, the effects of genetic depletion on evolutionary potential are not easily reversed. In this study, a non-invasive genetic analysis of the Amur tiger subpopulation in Southwest Primorye was conducted using microsatellite loci and mitochondrial genes to estimate genetic diversity, relatedness, and determine the impact of historical demographic dynamics. A total of 32 individuals (16 males, 15 females, and 1 unidentified sex) were identified, and signs of bottlenecks were detected, reflecting past demographic events. Low genetic variation observed in mitochondrial DNA also revealed genetic depletion within the population. Most individuals were found to be closely related to each other, raising concerns about inbreeding given the small population size and somewhat isolated environment from the main population in Sikhote-Alin. These findings emphasize the urgent need to establish ecological corridors to neighboring areas to restore genetic diversity and ensure the conservation of the Amur tiger population in Southwest Primorye.","Animals; Tigers; Conservation of Natural Resources; Genetic Variation; Microsatellite Repeats; Male; Female; DNA, Mitochondrial; Russia; Genetics, Population; Population Density"
39622982,Aspergillus fumigatus,746128,Ndk,4833,Gaining molecular insights towards inhibition of foodborne fungi Aspergillus fumigatus by a food colourant violacein via computational approach.,"Filamentous Fungal Human Pathogens (FFHPs) such as Aspergillus fumigatus, are growing resistant to currently available antifungal drugs. One possible target, the Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) is significant for nucleotide biosynthesis and crucial for fungal metabolism. Violacein, a natural food colorant, was examined for its antifungal effects against Aspergillus fumigatus via computational approach against the Ndk protein. Known and predicted interactions of Ndk with proteins was performed using the STRING application. Molecular docking was performed using Schrodinger Maestro software (V.14.1) under enhanced precision docking, with OPLS4 forcefield. MDS was performed for 500ns under OPLS4 forcefield and the TIP3P solvent system. The geometry optimization for DFT was performed using the Becke 3-parameter exchange functional (B3LYP) method. The Molecular Docking Studies revealed significant interactions with good binding energy between Violacein and Ndk. Subsequent MD Simulations confirmed the stability of Violacein-Ndk complex, compared to the reference ligand-complex, indicating a stable interaction between the protein and violacein. The energy band gap of violacein was found to be 0.072567 eV suggesting its softness with lower kinetic stability and higher chemical reactivity. The results suggest Violacein could potentially disrupt nucleotide metabolism by targeting Ndk, thus demonstrating antifungal activity. However, further experimental validation is required to confirm these computational findings and explore the practical use of Violacein in antifungal treatments.",Aspergillus fumigatus; Indoles; Molecular Docking Simulation; Antifungal Agents; Food Coloring Agents; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Fungal Proteins; Microbial Sensitivity Tests
39623035,CT,365345,,,Immunoinformatics design of a multi-epitope vaccine for Chlamydia trachomatis major outer membrane proteins.,"Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) remains a significant infectious cause of blindness and sexually transmitted infections worldwide. The objective and novelty of this study lie in using different serovars of CT to design a broad-spectrum multi-epitope vaccine that might confer immunity against different CT infections. As the major outer membrane protein in CT has good immunodominance properties and high conservation and also determines the several serotypes of CT, it is selected as an antibody target in this study. T-cell and B-cell epitopes from serovars A, B, D, E, L1, and L2 were predicted and combined into a single construct by incorporating adjuvants and linkers to enhance immunogenicity and stability. Physicochemical characterization confirmed the constructed vaccine's anti-allergic, immunogenicity, and thermostable characteristics, followed by structural modeling to refine its 3D configuration. The 3D model structure of the vaccine was validated through the Ramachandran plot and ProSA z-score. Molecular docking studies of the vaccine demonstrated stable binding with toll-like receptor 3, along with molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations supporting the complex's stability. In silico cloning has indicated a high potential for expression in Escherichia coli. Lastly, immune simulations revealed robust activation of B cells, cytotoxic T cells, and antigen-presenting cells, alongside significant production of IgM, IgG antibodies, and balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine response, which is crucial for effective immunity. These results suggest the multi-epitope vaccine could effectively induce comprehensive immune responses against CT, highlighting the need for further in vivo validation to advance this promising candidate toward clinical use.","Chlamydia trachomatis; Bacterial Vaccines; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Molecular Docking Simulation; Humans; Computational Biology; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Chlamydia Infections; Antibodies, Bacterial; Immunoinformatics"
39623141,Bacillus subtilis,1423,,,Flagellar rotation facilitates the transfer of a bacterial conjugative plasmid.,"Conjugation-mediated DNA delivery is the primary mode for antibiotic resistance spread in bacteria; yet, molecular mechanisms regulating the conjugation process remain largely unexplored. While conjugative plasmids typically require bacterial attachment to solid surfaces for facilitation of donor-to-recipient proximity, the pLS20 conjugative plasmid, prevalent among Gram-positive Bacillus spp., uniquely requires fluid environments to enhance its transfer. Here, we show that pLS20, carried by Bacillus subtilis, induces multicellular clustering, which can accommodate various species, hence offering a stable platform for DNA delivery in a liquid milieu. We further discovered that induction of pLS20 promoters, governing crucial conjugative genes, is dependent on the presence of donor cell flagella, the major bacterial motility organelle. Moreover, the pLS20 regulatory circuit is controlled by a mechanosensing signal transduction pathway responsive to flagella rotation, thus activating conjugation gene expression exclusively during the host motile phase. This flagella-conjugation coupling strategy may allow the dissemination of the plasmid to remote destinations, allowing infiltration into new niches.","Flagella; Plasmids; Bacillus subtilis; Conjugation, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Bacterial Proteins"

This study aimed to analyse the spatial distribution of malaria cases and Anopheles species that act as vectors in the area. Using an observational design with a cross-sectional approach, data on malaria cases were collected from tiers from the Community Health Centre, District Health Office and Province, all of which were documented on the Ministry of Health's malaria information system for the period 2021-2023. Malaria Vector Distribution Data from the East Java Health Office and the research team directly. Sampling of mosquitoes and larvae was carried out by researchers using a purposive sampling method, which prioritised locations with districts that have a high risk factor for the presence of breeding Anopheles sp., namely, Treggalek District, Malang District and Pacitan District with diverse topography, such as coastal (lagoon), rice fields and hills. The results of the analysis show that the distribution of imported malaria cases in East Java is uneven, with hotspots identified in several areas that have working population mobility from outside the East Java region. The presence of Anopheles species, particularly An. sundaicus and An. maculatus, contributes to their potential as vectors of malaria transmission, with An. sundaicus being more common in coastal areas and An. maculatus in valley and paddy fields. Environmental factors, such as topography of the region, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, influence the variation of Anopheles species. This study emphasises the importance of an ecosystem-based approach to malaria control, as well as the need to improve access to health services and community education. The findings provide important insights for the development of more effective and sustainable health policies in an effort to maintain malaria elimination areas in East Java.",
39623505,Xenopus,8355,beta-catenin,399274,A transphyletic study of metazoan β-catenin protein complexes.,"Beta-catenin is essential for diverse biological processes, such as body axis determination and cell differentiation, during metazoan embryonic development. Beta-catenin is thought to exert such functions through complexes formed with various proteins. Although β-catenin complex proteins have been identified in several bilaterians, little is known about the structural and functional properties of β-catenin complexes in early metazoan evolution. In the present study, we performed a comparative analysis of β-catenin sequences in nonbilaterian lineages that diverged early in metazoan evolution. We also carried out transphyletic function experiments with β-catenin from nonbilaterian metazoans using developing Xenopus embryos, including secondary axis induction in embryos and proteomic analysis of β-catenin protein complexes. Comparative functional analysis of nonbilaterian β-catenins demonstrated sequence characteristics important for β-catenin functions, and the deep origin and evolutionary conservation of the cadherin-catenin complex. Proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with β-catenin included several proteins conserved among metazoans. These data provide new insights into the conserved repertoire of β-catenin complexes.",
