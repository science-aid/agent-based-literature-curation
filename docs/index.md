# Agent-based Literature Curation

## What is this?

**Validation of AI Agent-Based Curation for Low-Noise Literature Set Construction**

This repository provides complete research materials for validating AI agent-based literature curation methods, including:

- Comprehensive research documentation and findings
- Full analysis scripts and implementation code
- Experimental datasets and evaluation results
- Docker environment for reproducibility

**Built with Biomni**: This research is built upon [Biomni](https://biomni.stanford.edu/), an open-source AI agent framework developed at Stanford University for biological and biomedical research.

## Methodology

We tested **three different approaches** for literature curation and validated their performance by comparing **Precision** scores:

- **Default Biomni**: A Biomni AI agent with default configuration
- **Custom Biomni**: A Biomni AI agent with custom enhancements
- **PubTator**: NCBI's annotation system

!!! note "Performance Metrics"
    Currently validated using **Precision** only. Other metrics such as Accuracy and F1-score are not yet evaluated.
